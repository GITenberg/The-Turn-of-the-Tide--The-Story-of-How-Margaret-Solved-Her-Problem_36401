<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>
Margaret had been home two hours—two
hours of breathless questions, answers,
tears, and laughter—two hours
of delighted wandering about the house and
grounds.
</p>
<p>
In the nursery she had seen the little woolly
dog that lay on the floor just as she had left it
five years before; and out on the veranda steps
she had seen the great stone lions that had never
quite faded from her memory. And always at
her side had walked the sweet-faced lady of her
dreams, only now the lady was very real, with
eyes that smiled on one so lovingly, and lips and
hands that kissed and caressed one so tenderly.
</p>
<p>
“And this is home—my home?” Margaret
asked in unbelieving wonder.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dear,” answered Mrs. Kendall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
</p>
<p>
“And you are my mother, and I am Margaret
Kendall, your little girl?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“And the little dog on the floor—that was
mine, and—and it’s been there ever since?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ever since you left it there long ago. I—I
could not bear to have any one move it, or
touch it.”
</p>
<p>
“And I was lost then—right then?”
</p>
<p>
“No, dear. We traveled about for almost a
year. You were five when I lost you.” Mrs.
Kendall’s voice shook. Unconsciously she drew
Margaret into a closer embrace. Even now she
was scarcely sure that it was Margaret—this little
maid who had stepped so suddenly out of the
great silence that had closed about her four long
years before.
</p>
<p>
Margaret laughed softly, and nestled in the
encircling arms.
</p>
<p>
“I like it—this,” she confided shyly. “You
see, I—I hain’t had it before. Even the dream-lady
didn’t do—this.”
</p>
<p>
“The dream-lady?”
</p>
<p>
Margaret hesitated. Her grave eyes were on
her mother’s face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
</p>
<p>
“I suppose she was—you,” she said then slowly.
“I saw her nights, mostly; but she never stayed,
and when I tried to catch her, she—she was just
air—and wasn’t there at all. And I did want her
so bad!”
</p>
<p>
“Of course you did, sweetheart,” choked Mrs.
Kendall, tremulously. “And didn’t she ever stay?
When was it you saw her—first?”
</p>
<p>
Margaret frowned.
</p>
<p>
“I—don’t—seem—to know,” she answered.
She was thinking of what Dr. Spencer had told
her, and of what she herself remembered of those
four years of her life. “You see first I was lost,
and Bobby McGinnis found me. Anyhow, Dr.
Spencer says he did, but I don’t seem to remember.
Things was all mixed up. There didn’t
seem to be anybody that wanted me, but there
wouldn’t anybody let me go. And they made
me sew all the time on things that was big and
homely, and then another man took me and made
me paste up bags. Say, did you ever paste bags?”
</p>
<p>
“No, dear.” Mrs. Kendall shivered.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you don’t want to,” volunteered Margaret;
and to her thin little face came the look that
her mother had already seen on it once or twice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
that afternoon—the look of a child who knows
what it means to fight for life itself in the slums of
a great city. “They ain’t a mite nice—bags ain’t;
and the paste sticks horrid, and smells.”
</p>
<p>
“Margaret, dearest!—how could you bear it?”
shuddered Mrs. Kendall, her eyes brimming with
tears.
</p>
<p>
Margaret saw the tears, and understood—this
tender, new-found mother of hers was grieved;
she must be comforted. To the best of her ability,
therefore, Margaret promptly proceeded to administer
that comfort.
</p>
<p>
“Pooh! ‘twa’n’t nothin’,” she asserted stoutly;
“besides, I runned away, and then I had a tiptop
place—a whole corner of Mis’ Whalen’s kitchen,
and jest me and Patty and the twins to stay in it.
We divvied up everythin’, and some days we had
heaps to eat—truly we did—heaps! And I went
to Mont-Lawn two times, and of course there I
had everythin’, even beds with sheets, you know;
and——”
</p>
<p>
“Margaret, Margaret, don’t, dear!” interrupted
her mother. “I can’t bear even to think of it.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret’s eyes grew puzzled.
</p>
<p>
“But that was bang-up—all of it,” she protested earnestly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
“Why, I didn’t paste bags nor
sew buttons, and nobody didn’t strike me for not
doin’ ’em, neither; and Mis’ Whalen was good
and showed me how to make flowers—for pay,
too! And——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dear, I know,” interposed Mrs. Kendall
again; “but suppose we don’t think any more of
all that, sweetheart. You are home now, darling,
right here with mother. Come, we will go out
into the garden.” To Mrs. Kendall it seemed at
the moment that only God’s blessed out-of-doors
was wide enough and beautiful enough to clear
from her eyes the pictures Margaret’s words had
painted.
</p>
<p>
Out in the garden Margaret drew a long breath.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” she cooed softly, caressing with her
cheek a great red rose. “I knew flowers smelled
good, but I didn’t find it out for sure till I went to
Mont-Lawn that first time. You see the kind we
made was cloth and stiff, and they didn’t smell
good a mite—oh, you’ve picked it!” she broke
off, half-rapturously, half-regretfully, as Mrs. Kendall
placed in her hands the great red rose.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, pick all you like, dear,” smiled Mrs.
Kendall, reaching for another flower.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
</p>
<p>
“But they’ll die,” stammered Margaret, “and
then the others won’t see them.”
</p>
<p>
“The—‘others’? What others, dear?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, the other folks that live here, you know,
and walk out here, too.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kendall laughed merrily.
</p>
<p>
“But there aren’t any others, dear. The flowers
are all ours. No one else lives here.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret stopped short in the garden path and
faced her mother.
</p>
<p>
“What, not any one? in all that big house?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, no, dear, of course not. There is no
one except old Mr. and Mrs. Barrett who keep the
house and grounds in order. We have it all to
ourselves.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret was silent. She turned and walked
slowly along the path at her mother’s side. On
her face was a puzzled questioning. To her eyes
was gradually coming a frightened doubt.
</p>
<p>
Alone?—just they two, with the little old man
and the little old woman in the kitchen who did
not take up any room at all? Why, back in the
Alley there were Patty, the twins, and all the
Whalens—and they had only one room! It was
like that, too, everywhere, all through the Alley—so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
many, many people, so little room for them.
Yet here—here was this great house all windows
and doors and soft carpets and pretty pictures,
and only two, three, four people to enjoy it all.
Why had not her mother asked——
</p>
<p>
Even to herself Margaret could not say the
words. She shut her lips tight and threw a
hurried look into the face of the woman at her
side. This dear dream-lady, this beautiful new
mother—as if there could be any question of her
goodness and kindness! Very likely, anyway,
there were not any poor——
</p>
<p>
Margaret’s eyes cleared suddenly. She turned
a radiant face on her mother.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know,” she cried in triumph. “There
ain’t any poor folks here, and so you couldn’t do
it!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kendall looked puzzled.
</p>
<p>
“‘Poor folks’? ‘Couldn’t do it’?” she questioned.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; poor folks like Patty and the Whalens,
and so you couldn’t ask ’em to live with you.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kendall sat down abruptly. Near her was
a garden settee. She felt particularly glad of its
support just then.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
“And of course you didn’t know about the
Whalens and Patty,” went on Margaret, eagerly,
“and so you couldn’t ask them, neither. But you
do now, and they’d just love to come, I know!”
</p>
<p>
“Love to—to come?” stammered Mrs. Kendall,
gazing blankly into the glowing young face
before her.
</p>
<p>
“Of course they would!” nodded Margaret,
dancing up and down and clapping her hands.
“Wouldn’t you if you didn’t have nothin’ but a
room right down under the sidewalk, and there
was such a heap of folks in it? Why, here there’s
everythin’—<em>everythin’</em> for ’em, and oh, I’m so
glad, ’cause they <em>was</em> good to me—so good!
First Mis’ Whalen took in Patty and the twins
when the rent man dumped ’em out on the sidewalk,
and she gave ’em a whole corner of her
kitchen. And then when I runned away from the
bag-pasting, Patty and the twins took me in.
And now I can pay ’em back for it all—I can pay
’em back. I’m so glad!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kendall fell back limply against the garden
seat. Twice she opened her lips—and closed
them again. Her face flushed, then paled, and her
hands grew cold in her lap.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
</p>
<p>
This dancing little maid with the sunlit hair
and the astounding proposition to adopt into their
home two whole families from the slums of New
York, was Margaret, her own little Margaret, lost
so long ago, and now so miraculously restored to
her. As if she could refuse any request, however
wild, from Margaret! But this—!
</p>
<p>
“But, sweetheart, perhaps they—they wouldn’t
want to go away forever and leave their home,”
she remonstrated at last, feebly.
</p>
<p>
The child frowned, her finger to her lips.
</p>
<p>
“Well, anyhow, we can ask them,” she declared,
after a minute, her face clearing.
</p>
<p>
“Suppose we—we make it a visit, first,” suggested
Mrs. Kendall, feverishly. “By and by,
after I’ve had you all to myself for a little while,
you shall ask them to—to visit you.”
</p>
<p>
“O bully!” agreed Margaret in swift delight.
“That will be nicest; won’t it? Then they can
see how they like it—but there! they’ll like it all
right. They couldn’t help it.”
</p>
<p>
“And how—how many are there?” questioned
Mrs. Kendall, moistening her dry lips, and feeling
profoundly thankful for even this respite from the
proposed wholesale adoption.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, let’s see.” Margaret held up her fingers
and checked off her prospective guests. “There’s
Patty, she’s the oldest, and Arabella and Clarabella—they’re
the twins an’ they’re my age, you
know—that’s the Murphys. And then there’s all
the Whalens: Tom, Peter, Mary, Jamie, and—oh,
I dunno, six or eight, maybe, with Mis’ Whalen
and her husband. But, after all, it don’t make so
very much diff’rence just how many there are;
does it?” she added, with a happy little skip and
jump, “’cause there’s heaps of room here for any
‘mount of ’em. And I never can remember just
how many there are without forgettin’ some of
’em. You—you don’t mind if I don’t name ’em
all—now?” And she gazed earnestly into her
mother’s face.
</p>
<p>
“No, dear, no,” assured Mrs. Kendall, hurriedly.
“You—you have named quite enough.
And now we’ll go down to the brook. We haven’t
seen half of Five Oaks yet.” And once more she
tried to make the joyous present drive from her
daughter’s thoughts the grievous past.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>
It was not long before all Houghtonsville
knew the story, and there was not a man,
woman, or child in the town that did not
take the liveliest interest in the little maid at Five
Oaks who had passed through so amazing an
experience. To be lost at five years of age in a
great city, to be snatched from wealth, happiness,
and a loving mother’s arms, only to be thrust
instantly into poverty, misery, and loneliness; and
then to be, after four long years, suddenly returned—no
wonder Houghtonsville held its breath
and questioned if it all indeed were true.
</p>
<p>
Bit by bit the little girl’s history was related in
every house in town; and many a woman—and
some men—wept over the tale of how the little
fingers had sewed on buttons in the attic sweat
shop, and pasted bags in the ill-smelling cellar.
The story of the coöperative housekeeping establishment
in one corner of the basement kitchen,
where she, together with Patty and the twins,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
“divvied up” the day’s “haul,”—that, too, came
in for its share of exclamatory adjectives, as did
the account of how she was finally discovered
through her finding her own name over the little
cot-bed at Mont-Lawn—the little bed that Mrs.
Kendall had endowed in the name of her lost
daughter, in the children’s vacation home for the
poor little waifs from the city.
</p>
<p>
“An’ ter think of her findin’ her own baby jest
by givin’ some other woman’s baby a bit of joy!”
cried Mrs. Merton of the old red farmhouse, when
the story was told to her. “But, there! ain’t that
what she’s always doin’ for folks—somethin’ ter
make ’em happy? Didn’t she bring my own
child, Sadie, an’ the boy, Bobby, back from the
city, and ain’t Sadie gettin’ well an’ strong on the
farm here? And it’s a comfort ter me, too, when
I remember ’twas Bobby who first found the little
Margaret cryin’ in the streets there in New York,
an’ took her home ter my Sadie. ‘Twa’n’t much
Sadie could do for the poor little lamb, but
she did what she could till old Sullivan got his
claws on her and kept her shut up out o’ sight.
But there! what’s past is past, and there ain’t no
use frettin’ over it. She’s home now, in her own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
mother’s arms, and I’m thinkin’ it’s the whole
town that’s rejoicin’!”
</p>
<p>
And the whole town did rejoice—and many
and various were the ways the townspeople took
to show it. The Houghtonsville brass band
marched in full uniform to Five Oaks one evening
and gave a serenade with red fire and rockets,
much to Mrs. Kendall’s embarrassment and
Margaret’s delight. The Ladies’ Aid Society
gave a tea with Mrs. Kendall and Margaret as a
kind of pivot around which the entire affair revolved—this
time to the embarrassment of both
Mrs. Kendall and her daughter. The minister of
the Methodist church appointed a day of prayer
and thanksgiving in commemoration of the homecoming
of the wanderer; and the town poet published
in the <em>Houghtonsville Banner</em> a forty-eight-line
poem on “The Lost and Found.”
</p>
<p>
Nor was this all. To Mrs. Kendall it seemed
that almost every man, woman, and child in the
place came to her door with inquiries and congratulations,
together with all sorts of offerings,
from flowers and frosted cakes to tidies and
worked bedspreads. She was not ungrateful,
certainly, but she was overwhelmed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
</p>
<p>
Not only the cakes and the tidies, however,
gave Mrs. Kendall food for thought during those
first few days after Margaret’s return. From the
very nature of the case it was, of necessity, a
period of adjustment; and to Mrs. Kendall’s consternation
there was every indication of friction,
if not disaster.
</p>
<p>
For four years now her young daughter had
been away from her tender care and influence;
and for only one of those four years—the last—had
she come under the influence of any sort of
refinement or culture, and then under only such
as a city missionary and an overworked schoolteacher
could afford, supplemented by the two
trips to Mont-Lawn. To be sure, behind it all
had been Margaret’s careful training for the first
five years of her life, and it was because of this
training that she had so quickly yielded to what
good influences she had known in the last year.
The Alley, however, was not Five Oaks; and the
standards of one did not measure to those of the
other. It was not easy for “Mag of the Alley”
to become at once Margaret Kendall, the dainty
little daughter of a well-bred, fastidious mother.
</p>
<p>
To the doctor—the doctor who had gone to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
New York and brought Margaret home, and who
knew her as she was—Mrs. Kendall went for advice.
</p>
<p>
“What shall I do?” she asked anxiously. “A
hundred times a day the dear child’s speech,
movements, and actions are not what I like them
to be. And yet—if I correct each one, ’twill be a
continual ‘don’t’ all day. Why, doctor, the
child will—hate me!”
</p>
<p>
“As if any one could do that!” smiled the
doctor; and at the look in his eyes Mrs. Kendall
dropped her own—the happiness that had come
to her with this man’s love was very new; she
had scarcely yet looked it squarely in the face.
</p>
<p>
“The child is so good and loving,” she went
on a little hurriedly, “that it makes it all the
harder—but I must do something. Only this
morning she told the minister that she thought
Houghtonsville was a ‘bully place,’ and that the
people were ‘tiptop.’ Her table manners—poor
child! I ran away from the table and cried like a
baby the first time I saw her eat; and yet—perhaps
the very next thing she does will be so dainty and
sweet that I could declare the other was all a
dream. Doctor, what shall I do?”
</p>
<p>
“I know, I know,” nodded the man. “I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
seen it myself. But, dear, she’ll learn—she’ll
learn wonderfully fast. You’ll see. It’s in her—the
gentleness and the refinement. She’ll have
to be corrected, some, of course; it’s out of the
question that she shouldn’t be. But she’ll come
out straight. Her heart is all right.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kendall laughed softly.
</p>
<p>
“Her heart, doctor!” she exclaimed. “Just
there lies the greatest problem of all. The one
creed of her life is to ‘divvy up,’ and how I’m
going to teach her ordinary ideas of living without
shattering all her faith in me I don’t know.
Why, Harry,”—Mrs. Kendall’s voice was tragic—“she
gazes at me with round eyes of horror because
I have two coats and two hats, and two
loaves of bread, and haven’t yet ‘divvied up’
with some one who has none. So far her horror
is tempered by the fact that she is sure I didn’t
know before that there were any people who did
not have all these things. Now that she has told
me of them, she confidently looks to me to do my
obvious duty at once.”
</p>
<p>
The doctor laughed.
</p>
<p>
“As if you weren’t always doing things for people,”
he said fondly. Then he grew suddenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
grave. “The dear child! I’m afraid that along
with her education and civilization her altruism
<em>will</em> get a few hard knocks. But—she’ll get over
that, too. You’ll see. At heart she’s so gentle
and—why, what”—he broke off with an unspoken
question, his eyes widely opened at the
change that had come to her face.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, nothing,” returned Mrs. Kendall, almost
despairingly, “only if you’d seen Joe Bagley yesterday
morning I’m afraid you’d have changed
your opinion of her gentleness. She—she fought
him!” Mrs. Kendall stumbled over the words,
and flushed a painful red as she spoke them.
</p>
<p>
“Fought him—Joe Bagley!” gasped the doctor.
“Why, he’s almost twice her size.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I know, but that didn’t seem to occur to
Margaret,” returned Mrs. Kendall. “She saw
only the kitten he was tormenting, and—well, she
rescued the kitten, and then administered what
she deemed to be fit punishment there and then.
When I arrived on the scene they were the center
of an admiring crowd of children,”—Mrs. Kendall
shivered visibly—“and Margaret was just delivering
herself of a final blow that sent the great bully
off blubbering.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
</p>
<p>
“Good for her!”—it was an involuntary tribute,
straight from the heart.
</p>
<p>
“Harry!” gasped Mrs. Kendall. “‘Good’—a
delicate girl!”
</p>
<p>
“No, no, of course not,” murmured the doctor,
hastily, though his eyes still glowed. “It won’t
do, of course; but you must remember her life,
her struggle for very existence all those years.
She <em>had</em> to train her fists to fight her way.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I suppose so,” admitted Mrs. Kendall,
faintly; but she shivered again, as if with a sudden
chill.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>
Scarcely had Houghtonsville recovered
from its first shock of glad surprise at Margaret’s
safe return, when it was shaken
again to its very center by the news of Mrs. Kendall’s
engagement to Dr. Spencer.
</p>
<p>
The old Kendall estate had been for more than a
generation the “show place” of the town. Even
during the years immediately following the loss
of little Margaret, when the great stone lions on
each side of the steps had kept guard over closed
doors and shuttered windows, even then the place
was pointed out to strangers for its beauty, as
well as for the tragedy that had so recently made it
a living tomb to its mistress. Sometimes, though
not often, a glimpse might be caught of a slender,
black-robed woman, and always there could be
seen the one unshuttered window on the second
floor. Every one knew the story of that window,
and of the sunlit room beyond where lay the little
woolly dog just as the baby hands had dropped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
it there years before; and every one knew that
the black-robed woman, widow of Frank Kendall
and mother of the lost little girl, was grieving her
heart out in the great lonely house.
</p>
<p>
Not until the last two years of Margaret’s absence
had there come a change, and then it was
so gradual that the townspeople scarcely noticed it.
Little by little, however, the air of gloom left the
house. One by one the blinds were thrown open
to the sunlight, and more and more frequently
Mrs. Kendall was seen walking in the garden, or
even upon the street. Not until the news of the
engagement had come, however, did Houghtonsville
people realize the doctor’s part in all this.
Then they understood. It was he who had administered
to her diseased body, and still more diseased
mind; he who had roused her from her
apathy of despair; and he who had taught her
that the world was full of other griefs even as bitter
as her own.
</p>
<p>
Not twenty-four hours after the news of the
engagement became public property, old Nathan—town
gossip, and driver-in-chief to a generation
of physicians, Dr. Spencer included—observed
triumphantly:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
</p>
<p>
“And I ain’t a mite surprised, neither. It’s a
good thing, too. They’re jest suited ter each
other. Ain’t they been traipsin’ all over town
tergether, an’ ridin’ whar ’twas too fur ter foot it?...
Ter be sure, they allers went ter some
one’s that was sick, an’ allers took jellies an’
things ter eat an’ read, but I had eyes, an’ I ain’t
a fool. She done good, though—heaps of it; an’
’tain’t no wonder the doctor fell head over heels
in love with her.... An’ thar was the
little gal, too. Didn’t he go twice ter New York
a-huntin’ fur her, an’ wa’n’t it through him that
they finally got her? ‘Course ’twas. ’Twas him
that told Mis’ Kendall ‘bout that ’ere Mont-Lawn
whar they sends them poor little city kids ter get
a breath o’ fresh air; an’ ’twas him that sent on
the twenty-one dollars for her, so’s she could
name a bed fur little Margaret; an’ ’twas him
that at last went ter New York an’ fetched her
home. Gorry, ’twas allers him. Thar wa’n’t no
way out of it, I say. They jest had ter get
engaged!”
</p>
<p>
It was not long before the most of Houghtonsville—in
sentiment, if not in words—came to old
Nathan’s opinion: this prospective marriage was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
an ideal arrangement, after all, and not in the
least surprising. There remained now only the
pleasant task of making the wedding a joyful
affair befitting the traditions of the town and of
the honored name of Kendall.
</p>
<p>
In all Houghtonsville, perhaps, there was only
one heart that did not beat in sympathy, and that
one, strangely enough, belonged to Mrs. Kendall’s
own daughter, Margaret.
</p>
<p>
“You mean you are goin’ to marry him, and
that he’ll be your husband for—for keeps?” Margaret
demanded with some agitation, when her
mother told her of the engagement.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kendall smiled. The red mounted to her
cheek.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dear,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“And he’ll live here—with us?” Margaret’s
voice was growing in horror.
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes, dear,” murmured Mrs. Kendall;
then, quizzically: “Why, sweetheart, what’s the
matter? Don’t you like Dr. Spencer? It was
only last week that you were begging me to ask
some one here to live with us.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret frowned anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“But, mother, dear, that was poor folks,” she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
explained, her eyes troubled. “Dr. Spencer ain’t
that kind, you know. You—you said he’d be a
husband.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes?”
</p>
<p>
“And—and husbands—mother!” broke off the
little girl, her voice sharp with anguished love
and terror. “He sha’n’t come here to beat you
and bang you ‘round—he just sha’n’t!”
</p>
<p>
“Beat me!” gasped Mrs. Kendall. “Margaret,
what in the world are you thinking of to
say such a thing as that?”
</p>
<p>
Margaret was almost crying now. The old
hunted look had come back to her eyes, and her
face looked suddenly pinched and old. She came
close to her mother’s side and caught the soft
folds of her mother’s dress in cold, shaking
fingers.
</p>
<p>
“But they do do it—all of ’em,” she warned
frenziedly. “Tim Sullivan, an’ Mr. Whalen, an’
Patty’s father—they was all husbands, every one
of ’em; and there wasn’t one of ’em but what beat
their wives and banged ’em ‘round. You don’t
know. You hain’t seen ’em, maybe; but they do
do it, mother—they do do it!”
</p>
<p>
For a moment Mrs. Kendall stared speechlessly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
into the young-old face before her; then she
caught the little girl in her arms.
</p>
<p>
“You poor little dear!” she choked. “You
poor forlorn little bunch of misguided pessimism!
Come, let me tell you how really good and kind
and gentle the doctor is. Beat me, indeed! Oh,
Margaret, Margaret!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>
In spite of Mrs. Kendall’s earnest efforts Margaret
was not easily convinced that marriage
might be desirable, and that all husbands
were not patterned after Tim Sullivan and Mike
Whalen. Nor was this coming marriage the only
thing that troubled Margaret. Life at the Alley
was still too vividly before her eyes to allow her
to understand any scheme of living that did not
recognize the supremacy of the sharpest tongue
and the heaviest fist; and this period of adjustment
to the new order of things was not without
its trials for herself as well as for her mother.
</p>
<p>
The beauty, love, and watchful care that surrounded
her filled her with ecstatic rapture; but
the niceties of speech and manner daily demanded
of her, terrified and dismayed her. Why “bully”
and “bang-up” should be frowned upon when,
after all, they but expressed her pleasure in something
provided for her happiness, she could not
understand; and why the handling of the absurdly
large number of knives, forks, and spoons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
about her plate at dinner should be a matter of so
great moment, she could not see. As for the
big white square of folded cloth that her mother
thought so necessary at every meal—its dainty
purity filled Margaret with dismay lest she soil or
wrinkle it; and for her part she would have much
preferred to let it quite alone.
</p>
<p>
There were the callers, too—beautiful ladies in
trailing gowns who insisted upon seeing her,
though why, Margaret could not understand; for
they invariably cried and said, “Poor little lamb!”
when they did see her, in spite of her efforts to
convince them that she was perfectly happy. And
there were the children—they, too, were disconcerting.
They came, sometimes alone, and sometimes
with their parents, but always they stared
and seemed afraid of her. There were others, to
be sure, who were not afraid of her. But they
never “called.” They “slipped in” through the
back gate at the foot of the garden, and they were
really very nice. They were Nat and Tom and
Roxy Trotter, and they lived in a little house
down by the river. They never wore shoes nor
stockings, and their clothes were not at all like
those of the other children. Margaret suspected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
that the Trotters were poor, and she took pains
that her mother should see Nat and Tom and
Roxy. Her mother, however, did not appear to
know them, which did not seem so very strange to
Margaret, after all; for of course her mother had
not known there were any poor people so near,
otherwise she would have shared her home with
them long ago. At first, it was Margaret’s plan
to rectify this little mistake immediately; but the
more she thought of it, the more thoroughly was
she convinced that the first chance belonged by
right to Patty’s family and the Whalens in New
York, inasmuch as they had been so good to her.
She determined, therefore, to wait awhile before
suggesting the removal of the Trotter family from
their tiny, inconvenient house to the more spacious
and desirable Five Oaks.
</p>
<p>
Delightful as were the Trotters, however, even
they did not quite come up to Bobby McGinnis
for real comradeship. Bobby lived with his mother
and grandmother in the little red farmhouse farther
up the hill. It was he who had found Margaret
crying in the streets on that first dreadful day long
ago when she was lost in New York. For a week
she had lived in his attic home, then she had become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
frightened at his father’s drunken rage, one
day, and had fled to the streets, never to return.
All this Margaret knew, though she had but a faint
recollection of it. It made a bond of sympathy
between them, nevertheless, and caused them to
become fast friends at once.
</p>
<p>
It was to Bobby that she went for advice when
the standards of Houghtonsville and the Alley
clashed; and it was to Bobby that she went for
sympathy when grievous mismanagement of the
knives and forks or of the folded square of cloth
brought disaster to herself and tears to her mother’s
eyes. She earnestly desired to—as she expressed
it to Bobby—“come up to the scratch and walk
straight”; and it was to Bobby that she looked
for aid and counsel.
</p>
<p>
“You see, you can tell just what ’tis ails me,”
she argued earnestly, as the two sat in their favorite
perch in the apple tree. “You don’t know
Patty and the Whalens, ‘course, but you do know
folks just like ’em; and mother—don’t you see?—she
knows only the kind that lives here, and she—she
don’t understand. But you know both
kinds, and you can tell where ’tis that I ain’t like
’em here. And I want to be like ’em, Bobby, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
do, truly. They’re just bang-up—I mean, <em>beautiful</em>
folks,” she corrected hastily. “And mother’s
so good to me! She’s just——”
</p>
<p>
Margaret stopped suddenly. A new thought
seemed to have come to her.
</p>
<p>
“Bobby,” she cried with sharp abruptness, “did
you ever know any husbands that was—good?”
</p>
<p>
“‘Husbands’? ‘Good’? What do ye mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Did you ever know any that was good, I mean
that didn’t beat their wives and bang ’em ‘round?
Did you, Bobby?”
</p>
<p>
Bobby laughed. He lifted his chin quizzically,
and gazed down from the lofty superiority of his
fourteen years.
</p>
<p>
“Sure, an’ ain’t ye beginnin’ sort o’ early ter
worry about husbands?” he teased. “But, mebbe
you’ve already—er—picked him out! eh?”
</p>
<p>
Margaret did not seem to hear. She was looking
straight through a little open space in the boughs
of the apple tree to the blue sky far beyond.
</p>
<p>
“Bobby,” she began in a voice scarcely above a
whisper, “if that man should be bad to my mother
I think I’d—kill him.”
</p>
<p>
Bobby roused himself. He suddenly remembered
Joe Bagley and the kitten.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
“What man?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Dr. Spencer.”
</p>
<p>
“Dr. Spencer!” gasped Bobby. “Why, Dr.
Spencer wouldn’t hurt a fly. He’s just bully!”
</p>
<p>
Margaret stirred restlessly. She turned a grave
face on her companion.
</p>
<p>
“Bobby,” she reproved gently, “I don’t think
I’d oughter hear them words if I ain’t ‘lowed to
use ’em myself.”
</p>
<p>
Bobby uptilted his chin.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve heard your ma say ‘ain’t’ wa’n’t proper,”
he observed virtuously. “I shouldn’t have mentioned
it, only—well, seein’ as how you’re gettin’
so awful particular——!” For the more telling
effect he left the sentence unfinished.
</p>
<p>
Again Margaret did not seem to hear. Again
her eyes had sought the patch of blue showing
through the green leaves.
</p>
<p>
“Dr. Spencer may be nice now, but he ain’t a
husband yet,” she said, thoughtfully. “There
was Tim Sullivan and Patty’s father and Mike
Whalen,” she enumerated aloud. “And they
was all—— Bobby, was your father a good husband?”
she demanded with a sudden turn that
brought her eyes squarely round to his.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
The boy was silent.
</p>
<p>
“Bobby, was he?”
</p>
<p>
Slowly the boy’s eyes fell.
</p>
<p>
“Well, of course, sometimes dad would”—he
began; but Margaret interrupted him.
</p>
<p>
“I knew it—I just knew it—I just knew there
wasn’t any,” she moaned; “but I can’t make
mother see it—I just can’t!”
</p>
<p>
This was but the first of many talks between
Margaret and Bobby upon the same subject, and
always Margaret was seeking for a possible averting
of the catastrophe. To convince her mother
of the awfulness of the fate awaiting her, and so
to persuade her to abandon the idea of marriage,
was out of the question, Margaret soon found. It
was then, perhaps, that the idea of speaking to the
doctor himself first came to her.
</p>
<p>
“If I could only get him to promise things!”
she said to Bobby. “If I could only get him to
promise!”
</p>
<p>
“Promise?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; to be good and kind, you know,” nodded
Margaret, “and not like a husband.”
</p>
<p>
Bobby laughed; then he frowned and was silent.
Suddenly his face changed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
</p>
<p>
“I say, you might make him sign a contract,”
he hazarded.
</p>
<p>
“Contract?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure! One of them things that makes folks
toe the mark whether they wants to or not. I’ll
draw it up for you—that’s what they call it,” he
explained airily; and as Margaret bubbled over
with delight and thanks he added: “Not at all.
’Tain’t nothin’. Glad ter do it, I’m sure!”
</p>
<p>
For a month now Bobby had swept the floor
and dusted the books in the law office of Burt &amp;
Burt, to say nothing of running errands and tending
door. In days gone by, the law, as represented
by the policeman on the corner, was something
to be avoided; but to-day, as represented
by a frock coat, a tall hat, and a vocabulary bristling
with big words, it was something that was
most alluring—so alluring, in fact, that Bobby had
determined to adopt it as his own. He himself
would be a lawyer—tall hat, frock coat, big words
and all. Hence his readiness to undertake this
little matter of drawing up a contract for Margaret,
his first client.
</p>
<p>
It was some days, nevertheless, before the work
was ready for the doctor’s signature. The young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
lawyer, unfortunately, could not give all of his
time to his own affairs; there were still the trivial
duties of his office to perform. He found, too,
that the big words which fell so glibly from the
lips of the great Burt &amp; Burt were anything but
easily managed when he tried to put them upon
paper himself. Bobby was ambitious and persistent,
however, and where knowledge failed,
imagination stepped boldly to the front. In the
end it was with no little pride that he displayed
the result of his labor to his client, then, with her
gleeful words of approval still ringing in his ears,
he slipped it into its envelope, sealed, stamped,
and posted it. Thus it happened that the next
day a very much amazed physician received this
in his mail:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
<em>“To whom it may concern</em>:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“Whereas, I, the Undersigned, being
in my sane Mind do intend to commit Matremony,
I, the said Undersigned do hereby solumly declare
and agree, to wit, not to Beat my aforesaid Wife.
Not to Bang her round. Not to Falsely, Wickedly
and Maliciously treat her. Not once. Moreover,
I, the said Undersigned do solumly Swear all this
to Margaret Kendall, the dorter and Lawfull Protectur
of the said Wife, to wit, Mrs. Kendall.
And whereas, if I, the aforesaid Undersigned do
break and violate this my solum Oath concerning
the said Wife, I do hereby Swear that she, to wit,
Margaret Kendall, may bestow upon me such
Punishmunt as seems eminuntly proper to her at
such time as she sees fit. Whereas and whereunto
I have this day set my Hand and Seal.”
</p>
<p>
Here followed a space for the signature, and a
somewhat thumbed, irregular daub of red sealing-wax.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>
It was a particularly warm July evening, but
a faint breeze from the west stirred the leaves
of the Crimson Rambler that climbed over
the front veranda at Five Oaks, and brought the
first relief from the scorching heat. The great
stone lions loomed out of the shadows and caught
the moonlight full on their shaggy heads. To the
doctor, sitting alone on the veranda steps, they
seemed almost alive, and he smiled at the thought
that came to him.
</p>
<p>
“So you think you, too, are guarding her,” he
chuckled quietly. “Pray, and are you also her
‘Lawfull Protectur’?”
</p>
<p>
A light step sounded on the floor behind him,
and he sprang to his feet.
</p>
<p>
“She’s asleep,” said Mrs. Kendall softly. “She
dropped asleep almost as soon as she touched the
pillow. Dear child!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, children are apt—— Amy, dearest!”
broke off the doctor, sharply, “you are crying!”
</p>
<p>
“No, no, it is nothing,” assured Mrs. Kendall,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
as the doctor led her to a chair. “It is always
this way, only to-night it was a—a little more
heart-breaking than usual.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Always this way’! ‘Heart-breaking’! Why,
Amy!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kendall smiled, then raised her hand to
brush away a tear.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t understand,” she murmured. “It’s
the bedtime prayer—Margaret’s;” then, at the
doctor’s amazed frown, she added: “The dear
child goes over her whole day, bit by bit, and
asks forgiveness for countless misdemeanors, and
it nearly breaks my heart, for it shows how many
times I have said ‘don’t’ to the poor little thing
since morning. And as if that were not piteous
enough, she must needs ask the dear Father to
tell her how to handle her fork, and how to sit,
walk, and talk so’s to please mother. Harry,
what <em>shall</em> I do?”
</p>
<p>
“But you are doing,” returned the doctor.
“You are loving her, and you are surrounding
her with everything good and beautiful.”
</p>
<p>
“But I want to do right myself—just right.”
</p>
<p>
“And you are doing just right, dear.”
</p>
<p>
“But the results—they are so irregular and uneven,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
sighed the mother, despairingly. “One
minute she is the gentle, loving little girl I held in
my arms five years ago; and the next she is—well,
she isn’t Margaret at all.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” smiled the doctor. “She isn’t Margaret
at all. She is Mag of the Alley, dependent on her
wits and her fists for life itself. Don’t worry,
sweetheart. It will all come right in time; it
can’t help it!—but it will take the time.”
</p>
<p>
“She tries so hard—the little precious!—and
she does love me.”
</p>
<p>
A curious smile curved the doctor’s lips.
</p>
<p>
“She does,” he said dryly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Harry, what——” Mrs. Kendall’s eyes
were questioning.
</p>
<p>
The doctor hesitated. Then very slowly he
drew from his pocket a large, somewhat legal-looking
document.
</p>
<p>
“I hardly know whether to share this with you
or not,” he began; “still, it <em>is</em> too good to keep
to myself, and it concerns you intimately; moreover,
you may be able to assist me with some
advice in the matter, or at least with some possible
explanation.” And he held out the paper.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kendall turned in her chair so that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
light from the open hall-door would fall upon the
round, cramped handwriting.
</p>
<p>
“‘To whom it may concern,’” she read aloud.
“‘Whereas, I, the Undersigned, being in my sane
Mind do intend to commit Matremony.’ Why,
Harry, what in the world is this?” she demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Go on,—read,” returned the doctor, with a
nonchalant wave of his hand; and Mrs. Kendall
dropped her eyes again to the paper.
</p>
<p>
“Harry, what in the world does this mean?”
she gasped a minute later as she finished reading,
half laughing, half crying, and wholly amazed.
</p>
<p>
“But that is exactly what I was going to ask
you,” parried the doctor.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean that Margaret wrote—but she
couldn’t; besides, it isn’t her writing.”
</p>
<p>
“No, Margaret didn’t write it. For that part I
think I detect the earmarks of young McGinnis.
At all events, it came from him.”
</p>
<p>
“Bobby?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“But who——” Mrs. Kendall stopped abruptly.
A dawning comprehension came into her eyes.
“You mean—Harry, she <em>was</em> at the bottom of it!
I remember now. It was only a week or two ago
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
that she used those same words to me. She insisted
that you would beat me and—and bang me
’round. Oh, Margaret, Margaret, my poor little
girl!”
</p>
<p>
The doctor smiled; then he shook his head
gravely.
</p>
<p>
“Poor child! She hasn’t seen much of conjugal
felicity; has she?” he murmured; then, softly:
“It is left for us, sweetheart, to teach her—that.”
</p>
<p>
The color deepened in Mrs. Kendall’s cheeks.
Her eyes softened, then danced merrily.
</p>
<p>
“But you haven’t signed—this, sir, yet!” she
challenged laughingly, as she held out the paper.
</p>
<p>
He caught both paper and hands in a warm
clasp.
</p>
<p>
“But I will,” he declared. “Wait and see!”
</p>
<p>
Not twenty hours later Bobby McGinnis halted
at the great gate of the driveway at Five Oaks
and gave a peculiar whistle. Almost instantly
Margaret flew across the lawn to meet him.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it’s jest a little matter of business,” greeted
Bobby, with careless ease. “I’ve got that ’ere
document here all signed. I reckoned the doctor
wouldn’t lose no time makin’ sure ter do his
part.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
</p>
<p>
“Bobby, not the contract—so soon!” exulted
Margaret.
</p>
<p>
“Sure! Why not? I told him ter please sign
to once an’ return. An’ he did, ‘course. I reckoned
he meant business in this little matter, an’
he reckoned I did, too. There wa’n’t nothin’ for
him ter do but sign, ’course.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret drew her brows together in a thoughtful
frown.
</p>
<p>
“But he might have—refused,” she suggested.
</p>
<p>
Bobby gave her a scornful glance.
</p>
<p>
“Refused—an’ lost the chance of marryin’ at
all? Not much!” he asserted with emphasis.
</p>
<p>
“Well, anyhow, I’m glad he didn’t,” sighed
Margaret, as she clutched the precious paper
close to her heart. “I should ‘a’ hated to have
refused outright to let him marry her when mother—Bobby,
mother actually seems to <em>want</em> to have
him!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>
Margaret had been at home four
weeks when the invitation for Patty,
Arabella, Clarabella, and three of the
Whalens to visit her, finally left her mother’s
hands. There had not been a day of all those
four weeks that Margaret had not talked of the
coming visit. At first, to be sure, she had not
called it a visit; she had referred to it as the
time when “Patty and the Whalens come here to
live.” Gradually, however, her mother had persuaded
her to let them “try it and see how they
liked it”; and to this compromise Margaret finally
gave a somewhat reluctant consent.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kendall herself was distinctly uneasy over
the whole affair; and on one pretext and another
had put off sending for the proposed guests until
Margaret’s importunities left her no choice in the
matter. Not but that she was grateful to the two
families that had been so good to Margaret in her
hour of need, but she would have preferred to
show that gratitude in some way not quite so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
intimate as taking them into her house and home
for an indefinite period. Margaret, however, was
still intent on “divvying up,” and Mrs. Kendall
could not look into her daughter’s clear blue eyes,
and explain why Patty, Arabella, Clarabella, and
the Whalens might not be the most desirable
guests in the world.
</p>
<p>
It had been Margaret’s intention to invite all of
the Whalen family. She had hesitated a little, it
is true, over Mike Whalen, the father.
</p>
<p>
“You see he drinks, and when he ain’t asleep
he’s cross, mostly,” she explained to her mother;
“but we can’t leave just him behind, so we’ll have
to ask him, ‘course. Besides, if he’s goin’ to live
here, why, he might as well come right now at
the first.”
</p>
<p>
“No, certainly we couldn’t leave Mr. Whalen
behind alone,” Mrs. Kendall had returned with
dry lips. “So suppose we don’t take any of the
Whalens this time—just devote ourselves to Patty
and the twins.”
</p>
<p>
To this, however, Margaret refused to give her
consent. What, not take any of the Whalens—the
Whalens who had been so good as to give
them one whole corner of their kitchen, rent free?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
Certainly not! She agreed, however, after considerable
discussion, to take only Tom, Mary, and
Peter of the Whalen family, leaving the rest of
the children and Mrs. Whalen to keep old Mike
Whalen company.
</p>
<p>
“For, after all,” as she said to her mother, “if
Tom and Mary and Peter like it here, the rest
will. They always like what Tom does—he makes
’em.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kendall never thought of that speech afterward
without a shudder. She even dreamed once
of this all-powerful Tom—he stood over her with
clinched fists and flashing eyes, demanding that
she “divvy up” to the last cent. Clearly as she
understood that this was only a dream, yet the
vision haunted her; and it was not without some
apprehension that she went with Margaret to the
station to meet her guests, on the day appointed.
</p>
<p>
A letter from Margaret had gone to Patty, and
one from Mrs. Kendall to Miss Murdock, the city
missionary who had been so good to Margaret.
Houghtonsville was on a main line to New York,
and but a few hours’ ride from the city. Mrs.
Kendall had given full instructions as to trains, and
had sent the money for the six tickets. She had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
also asked Miss Murdock to place the children in
care of the conductor, saying that she would meet
them herself at the Houghtonsville station.
</p>
<p>
Promptly in return had come Miss Murdock’s
letter telling of the children’s delighted acceptance
of the invitation; and almost immediately had followed
Patty’s elaborately flourished scrawl:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“Much obliged for de invite an wes Acomin. Tanks.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“Clarabella, Arabella, an</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“Patty at yer service.”</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kendall thought of this letter and of Tom
as she stood waiting for the long train from New
York to come to a standstill; then she looked
down at the sweet-faced daintily-gowned little
maid at her side, and shuddered—it is one thing
to carry beef-tea and wheel-chairs to our unfortunate
fellow men, and quite another to invite
those same fellow men to a seat at our own table
or by our own fireside.
</p>
<p>
Margaret and her mother had not long to wait.
Tom Whalen, in spite of the conductor’s restraining
hand, was on the platform before the wheels
had ceased to turn. Behind him tumbled Peter,
Mary, and Clarabella, while Patty, carefully guiding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
Arabella’s twisted feet, brought up the rear.
There was an instant’s pause; then Tom spied
Margaret, and with a triumphant “Come on—here
she is!” to those behind, he dashed down the
platform.
</p>
<p>
“My, but ain’t you slick!” he cried admiringly,
stopping short before Margaret, who had unconsciously
shrunk close to her mother’s side. “Hi,
thar, Patty,” he called, hailing the gleeful children
behind him, “what would the Alley say if they
could see her now?”
</p>
<p>
There was a moment’s pause. Eagerly as the
children had followed Tom’s lead, they stood
abashed now before the tall, beautiful woman and
the pretty little girl they had once known as
“Mag of the Alley.” Almost instantly Margaret
saw and understood; and with all the strength of
her hospitable little soul she strove to put her
guests at their ease. With a glad little cry she
gave one after another a bear-like hug; then she
stood back with a flourish and prepared for the introductions.
Unconsciously her words and manner
aped those of her mother in sundry other introductions
that had figured in her own experience
during the last four weeks; and before Mrs. Kendall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
knew what was happening she found herself
being ceremoniously presented to Tom Whalen,
late of the Alley, New York.
</p>
<p>
“Tom, this is my dear mother that I lost long
ago,” said Margaret. “Mother, dear, can’t you
shake hands with Tom?”
</p>
<p>
Tom advanced. His face was a fiery red, and
the freckles shone luridly through the glow.
</p>
<p>
“Proud ter know ye, ma’am,” he stammered,
clutching frantically at the daintily-gloved, outstretched
hand.
</p>
<p>
Margaret sighed with relief. Tom did know how
to behave, after all. She had feared he would not.
</p>
<p>
“And this is Mary Whalen, and Peter,” she
went on, as Mrs. Kendall clasped in turn two limp
hands belonging to a white-faced girl and a frightened
boy. “And here’s Patty and the twins,
Clarabella and Arabella; and now you know ’em
all,” finished Margaret, beaming joyously upon
her mother who was leaning with tender eyes over
the little lame Arabella.
</p>
<p>
“My dear, how thin your poor little cheeks are,”
Mrs. Kendall was saying.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, she is kind o’ peaked,” volunteered Patty.
“Miss Murdock says as how her food don’t ‘similate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
Ye see she ain’t over strong, anyhow, on
account o’ dem,” pointing to the little twisted feet
and legs. “Mebbe Maggie told ye, ma’am, how
Arabella wa’n’t finished up right, an’ how her legs
didn’t go straight like ours,” added Patty, giving
her usual explanation of her sister’s misfortune.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” choked Mrs. Kendall, hurriedly. “She
told me that the little girl was lame. Now, my
dears, we—we’ll go home.” Mrs. Kendall hesitated
and looked about her. “You—you haven’t
any bags or—or anything?” she asked them.
</p>
<p>
“Gee!” cried Tom, turning sharply toward the
track where had stood a moment before the train
that brought them. “An’ if ’tain’t gone so
soon!”
</p>
<p>
“Gone—the bag?” chorused five shrill voices.
</p>
<p>
“Sure!” nodded Tom. Then, with a resigned
air, he thrust both hands into his trousers pockets.
“Gone she is, bag and baggage.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m so sorry,” murmured Mrs. Kendall.
</p>
<p>
“Pooh! ’tain’t a mite o’ matter,” assured Patty,
quickly. “Ye see, dar wa’n’t nothin’ in it, anyhow,
only a extry ribb’n fur Arabella’s hair.”
Then, at Mrs. Kendall’s blank look of amazement,
she explained: “We only took it ’cause Katy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
Sovrensky said folks allers took ’em when they
went trav’lin’. So we fished dis out o’ de ash
barrel an’ fixed it up wid strings an’ tacks. We
didn’t have nothin’ ter put in it, ‘course. All our
clo’s is on us.”
</p>
<p>
“We didn’t need nothin’ else, anyhow,” piped
up Arabella, “for all our things is span clean.
We went ter bed ‘most all day yisterday so’s
Patty could wash ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes, of course, certainly,” agreed Mrs.
Kendall, faintly, as she turned and led the way to
the big four-seated carryall waiting for them.
“Then we’ll go home right away.”
</p>
<p>
To Tom, Peter, Mary, Patty, Arabella, and
Clarabella, it was all so wonderful that they fairly
pinched themselves to make sure they were awake.
The drive through the elm-bordered streets with
everywhere flowers, vine-covered houses, and
velvety lawns—it was all quite unbelievable.
</p>
<p>
“It’s more like Mont-Lawn than anythin’ I ever
see,” murmured Arabella. “Seems ‘most as
though ’twas heaven.” And Mrs. Kendall, who
heard the words, reproached herself because for
four long weeks she had stood jealous guard over
this “heaven” and refused to “divvy up” its enjoyment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
The next moment she shuddered and
unconsciously drew Margaret close to her side.
Patty had said:
</p>
<p>
“Gee whiz, Mag, ain’t you lucky? Wis’t I was
a lost an’ founded!”
</p>
<p>
The house with its great stone lions was hailed
with an awed “oh-h!” of delight, as were the
wide lawns and brilliant flower-beds. Inside the
house the children blinked in amazement at the
lace-hung windows, and gold-framed pictures;
and Clarabella, balancing herself on her toes,
looked fearfully at the woven pinks and roses at
her feet and demanded: “Don’t walkin’ on ’em
hurt ’em?
</p>
<p>
“Seems so ‘twould,” she added, her eyes distrustfully
bent on Margaret who had laughed, and
by way of proving the carpet’s durability, was
dancing up and down upon it.
</p>
<p>
The matter of choosing beds in the wide, airy
chambers was a momentous one. In the boys’
room, to be sure, it was a simple matter, for there
were only two beds, and Tom settled the question
at once by unceremoniously throwing Peter on to
one of them, and pommeling him with the pillow
until he howled for mercy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
The girls had two rooms opening out of each
other, and in each room were two dainty white
beds. Here the matter of choosing was only settled
amicably at last by a rigid system of “counting
out” by “Eeny, meany, miny, mo”; and
even this was not accomplished without much
shouting and laughter, and not a few angry
words.
</p>
<p>
Margaret was distressed. For a time she was
silent; then she threw herself into the discussion
with all the ardor of one who would bring peace
at any cost; and it was by her suggestion that the
“Eeny, meany, miny, mo,” finally won the day.
In her own room that night, as she went to bed,
she apologized to her mother.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry they was so rude, mother. I had
forgot they was quite so noisy,” she confessed
anxiously. “But I’ll tell ’em to-morrow to be
more quiet. Maybe they didn’t know that little
ladies and little gentlemen don’t act like that.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>
Five oaks awoke to a new existence on
the first morning after the arrival of its
guests from New York—an existence of
wild shouts, gleeful laughter, scampering feet
and confusion. In the kitchen and the garden
old Mr. and Mrs. Barrett no longer held full sway.
For some time there had been a cook, a waitress,
a laundress, and an experienced gardener as well.
In the barn, too, there was now a stalwart fellow
who was coachman and chauffeur by turns, according
to whether the old family carriage or the new
four-cylinder touring car was wanted.
</p>
<p>
Tom, Peter, Mary, Patty, and the twins had not
been at Five Oaks twenty-four hours before they
were fitted to new clothing throughout. Mrs.
Kendall had not slept until she had interviewed
the town clothier as to ways and means of immediately
providing two boys and four girls with
shoes, stockings, hats, coats, trousers, dresses, and
undergarments.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘Course ’tain’t ‘zactly necessary,” Patty had
said, upon being presented with her share of the
new garments, “but it’s awful nice, ’cause now
we don’t have ter go ter bed when ours is washed—an’
they be awful nice! Just bang-up!”
</p>
<p>
No wonder Five Oaks awoke to a new existence!
The wide-spreading lawns knew now what
it was to be pressed by a dozen little scampering
feet at once: and the great stone lions knew what
it was to have two yelling boys mount their carven
backs, and try to dig sharp little heels into
their stone sides. Within the house, the attic,
sacred for years to cobwebs and musty memories,
knew what it was to yield its treasured bonnets,
shawls, and quilted skirts to a swarm of noisy
children who demanded them for charades.
</p>
<p>
Tom, Peter, Mary, Patty, Arabella, and Clarabella
had been at Five Oaks two weeks when one
day Bobby McGinnis found Margaret crying all
alone in the old summerhouse down in the
garden.
</p>
<p>
“Gorry, what’s up?” he questioned; adding
cheerily: “‘Soldiers’ daughters don’t cry’!”—it
was a quotation from Margaret’s own childhood’s
creed, and one which in the old days seldom failed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
to dry her tears. Even now it was
not without its effect, for her head came up with a
jerk.
</p>
<p>
“I—I know it,” she sobbed; “and I ain’t—I
mean, I <em>are</em> not going to. There, you see,” she
broke off miserably, falling back into her old despondent
attitude. “‘Ain’t’ should be ‘are not’
always, and I never can remember.”
</p>
<p>
“Pooh! Is that all?” laughed Bobby.
“‘Twould take more’n a ‘are not’ ter make me
cry.”
</p>
<p>
“But that ain’t all,” wailed Margaret, and she
did not notice that at one of her words Bobby
chuckled and parted his lips only to close them
again with a snap. “There’s heaps more of ’em;
‘bully’ and ‘bang-up’ and ‘gee’ and ‘drownded’
and ‘g’ on the ends of things, and—well, almost
everything I say, seems so.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what of it? You’ll get over it. You’re
a-learnin’ all the time; ain’t ye?”
</p>
<p>
“‘Are not you,’ Bobby,” sighed Margaret.
</p>
<p>
“Well, ‘are not you,’ then,” snapped Bobby.
</p>
<p>
Margaret shook her head. A look that was
almost terror came to her eyes. She leaned forward
and clutched the boy’s arm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
</p>
<p>
“Bobby, that’s just it,” she whispered, looking
fearfully over her shoulder to make sure that no
one heard. “That’s just it—I’m not a-learnin’!”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?”
</p>
<p>
“Because of them—Tom, and Patty, and the
rest”
</p>
<p>
Bobby looked dazed, and Margaret plunged
headlong into her explanation.
</p>
<p>
“It’s them. They do ’em—all of ’em. Don’t
you see? They say ‘ain’t’ and ‘gee’ and ‘bully’
all the time, and I see now how bad ’tis, and I
want to stop. But I can’t stop, Bobby. I just
can’t. I try to, but it just comes before I know
it. I tried to stop them sayin’ ’em, first,” went on
Margaret, feverishly, “just as I tried to make ’em
act ladylike with their feet and their knives and
forks; but it didn’t do a mite o’ good. First they
laughed at me, then they got mad. You know
how ’twas, Bobby. You saw ’em.”
</p>
<p>
Bobby whistled.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I know,” he said soberly. “But when
they go away——”
</p>
<p>
“That’s just it,” cut in Margaret, tragically.
“I wa’n’t goin’ to have them go away. I was
goin’ to keep ’em always; and now I—Bobby, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
<em>want</em> them to go!” she paused and let the full
enormity of her confession sink into her hearer’s
comprehension. Then she repeated: “I want
them to go!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what of it?” retorted Bobby, with airy
unconcern.
</p>
<p>
“What of it!” wept Margaret. “Why, Bobby,
don’t you see? I was goin’ to divvy up, and I
ought to divvy up, too. I’ve got trees and grass
and flowers and beds with sheets on ’em and
enough to eat, and they hain’t got anything—not
anything. And now I don’t want to divvy up, I
don’t want to divvy up, because I don’t want them—here!”
</p>
<p>
Margaret covered her face with her hands and
rocked herself to and fro. Bobby was silent.
His hands were in his pocket, and his eyes were
on an ant struggling with a burden almost as
large as itself.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you see, Bobby, it’s wicked that I am—awful
wicked,” resumed Margaret, after a
minute. “I want to be nice and gentle like
mother wants me to be. I don’t want to be Mag
of the Alley. I—I hate Mag of the Alley. But
if Tom and Patty and the rest stays I shall be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
just like them, Bobby, I know I shall; and—and
so I don’t want ’em to stay.”
</p>
<p>
Bobby stirred uneasily, changing his position.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you—you hain’t asked ’em to, yet; have
ye?” he questioned.
</p>
<p>
“No. Mother ‘spressly stip’lated that I
shouldn’t say anything about their stayin’ always
till their visit was over and they saw how they
liked things.”
</p>
<p>
“Shucks!” rejoined Bobby, his face clearing.
“Then what ye cryin’ ‘bout? You ain’t bound
by no contract. You don’t have ter divvy up.”
</p>
<p>
“But I ought to divvy up.”
</p>
<p>
“Pooh! ‘Course ye hadn’t,” scoffed Bobby.
“Hain’t folks got a right ter have their own things?”
</p>
<p>
Margaret frowned doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” she began with some hesitation.
“If I’ve got nice things and more of ’em
than Patty has, why shouldn’t she have some of
mine? ’Tain’t fair, somehow. Somebody ain’t
playin’ straight. I—I’m goin’ to ask mother.”
And she turned slowly away and began to walk
toward the house.
</p>
<p>
Not once, but many times during the next few
days, did Margaret talk with her mother on this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
subject that so troubled her. The result of these
conferences Bobby learned not five days later
when Margaret ran down to meet him at the great
driveway gate. Back on the veranda Patty and
the others were playing “housekeeping,” and
Margaret spoke low so that they might not hear.
</p>
<p>
“I <em>am</em> goin’ to divvy up,” she announced in
triumph, “but not here.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh?” frowned Bobby.
</p>
<p>
“I <em>am</em> goin’ to divvy up—give ’em some of my
things, you know,” explained Margaret; “then
when they go back, mother’s goin’ with ’em and
find a better place for ’em to live in.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, then they are <em>goin’</em> back—eh?”
</p>
<p>
Margaret flushed a little and threw a questioning
look into Bobby’s face. There seemed to be
a laugh in Bobby’s voice, though there was none
on his lips.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she nodded hurriedly. “You see, mother
thinks it’s best. She says that they hadn’t ought
to be here now—with me; that it’s my form’tive
period, and that everything about me ought to be
just right so as to form me right. See?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I see,” said Bobby, so crossly that Margaret
opened her eyes in wonder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, Bobby, you don’t care ’cause they’re
goin’ away; do you?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t I?” he growled. “Humph! I s’pose
’twill be me next that’ll be sent flyin’.”
</p>
<p>
“You? Why, you live here!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I say ‘ain’t’ an’ ‘bully’; don’t I?” he
retorted aggressively.
</p>
<p>
Margaret stepped back. Her face changed.
</p>
<p>
“Why—so—you—do!” she breathed. “And
I never once thought of it.”
</p>
<p>
Bobby said nothing. He was standing on one
foot, digging the toe of the other into the graveled
driveway. For a time Margaret regarded him
with troubled eyes; then she sighed:
</p>
<p>
“Well, anyhow, you don’t live here all the time,
right in the house, same’s Patty and the rest
would if they stayed. I—I don’t want to give <em>you</em>
up, Bobby.”
</p>
<p>
Bobby flushed red under the tan. His eyes
sparkled with pleasure—but his chin went up, and
his hands executed the careless flourish that a boy
of fourteen is apt to use when he wishes to hide
the fact that his heart is touched.

<p>
“Don’t trouble yerself,” he shrugged airily.
“It don’t make a mite o’ diff’rence ter me, ye
know. There’s plenty I <em>can</em> be with.“ And he
turned and hurried up the road with long strides,
sending back over his shoulder a particularly joyous
whistle—a whistle that broke and wheezed
into silence, however, the minute that the woods
at the turn of the road were reached.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care,” he blustered, glaring at the chipmunk
that eyed him from the top rail of the fence.
“Bully—gee—ain’t—hain’t—bang-up! There!”
Then, having demonstrated his right to whatever
vocabulary he chose to employ, he went home to
the little red farmhouse on the hill and spent an
hour hunting for a certain book of his mother’s in
the attic. When he had found it he spent another
hour poring over its contents. The book
was old and yellow and dog-eared, and bore on
the faded pasteboard cover the words: “A work
on English Grammar and Composition.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>
Tom, Peter, Mary, Patty, and the twins
stayed at Five Oaks until the first of
September, then, plump, brown, and
happy they returned to New York. With them
went several articles of use and beauty which had
hitherto belonged to Five Oaks. Mrs. Kendall,
greatly relieved at Margaret’s somewhat surprising
willingness to let the visitors go, had finally consented
to Margaret’s proposition that the children
be allowed to select something they specially liked
to take back with them. In giving this consent,
Mrs. Kendall had made only such reservation as
would insure that certain valuable (and not easily
duplicated) treasures of her own should remain
undisturbed.
</p>
<p>
She smiled afterward at her fears. Tom selected
an old bugle from the attic, and Peter a scabbard
that had lost its sword. Mary chose a string of
blue beads that Margaret sometimes wore, and
Clarabella a pink sash that she found in a trunk.
Patty, before telling her choice, asked timidly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
what would happen if it was “too big ter be
tooked in yer hands.” Upon being assured that
it would be sent, if it could not be carried, she
unhesitatingly chose the biggest easy-chair the
house afforded, with the announcement that it
was “a Christmas present fur Mis’ Whalen.”
</p>
<p>
For a moment Mrs. Kendall had felt tempted
to remonstrate, and to ask Patty if she realized
just how a green satin-damask Turkish chair
would look in Mrs. Whalen’s basement kitchen;
but after one glance at Patty’s radiant face, she
had changed her mind, and had merely said:
</p>
<p>
“Very well, dear. It shall be sent the day you
go.”
</p>
<p>
Arabella only, of all the six, delayed her choice
until the final minute. Even on that last morning
she was hesitating between a marble statuette
and a harmonica. In the end she took neither,
for she had spied a huge chocolate-frosted cake
that the cook had just made; and it was that cake
which finally went to the station carefully packed
in a pasteboard box and triumphantly borne in
Arabella’s arms.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kendall herself went to New York with
the children, taking Margaret with her. In the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
Grand Central Station she shuddered a little as
she passed a certain seat. Involuntarily she
reached for her daughter’s hand.
</p>
<p>
“And was it here that I stayed and stayed that
day long ago when you got hurt and didn’t
come?” asked Margaret.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dear—right here.”
</p>
<p>
“Seems ’most as if I remembered,” murmured
the little girl, her eyes fixed on one of the great
doors across the room. “I stayed and stayed,
and you never came at all. And by and by I
went out there to look for you, and I walked
and walked and walked. And I was so tired and
hungry!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes, dear, I know,” faltered Mrs. Kendall,
tightening her clasp on the small fingers. “But
we won’t think of all that now, dear. It is past
and gone. Come, we’re going to take Patty and
the others home, you know, then to-morrow we are
going to see if we can’t find a new home for them.”
</p>
<p>
“Divvy up!” cried Margaret, brightening.
“We’re goin’ to divvy up!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dear.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” breathed Margaret, ecstatically. “I like
to divvy up!” And the mother smiled content,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
for the last trace of gloomy brooding had fled
from her daughter’s face, and left it glowing with
the joy of a care-free child.
</p>
<p>
Not two hours later a certain alley in the great
city was thrown into wild confusion. Out of every
window leaned disheveled heads, and in every
doorway stood a peering, questioning throng.
Down by the Whalens’ basement door, the crowd
was almost impassable; and every inch of space
in the windows opposite was filled with gesticulating
men, women, and children.
</p>
<p>
Mag of the Alley had come back. And, as if
that were not excitement enough for once, with
her had come Tom, Mary, Peter, Patty, and the
twins, to say nothing of the beautiful lady with
the golden hair, and the white wings on her hat.
</p>
<p>
“An’ she’s all dressed up fit ter kill—Maggie
is,” Katy Goldburg was calling excitedly over her
shoulder. Katy, and Tony Valerio had the advantage
over the others, for they were down on
their knees before the Whalens’ window on a
level with the sidewalk. The room inside was
almost in darkness, to be sure, for the crowd outside
had obscured what little daylight there was
left, and there was only the sputtering kerosene
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
lamp on the table for illumination. Even this,
however, sufficed to show Katy and Tony wonders
that unloosed their tongues and set them to
giving copious reports.
</p>
<p>
“She’s got a white dress on, an’ a hat with
posies, an’ shoes an’ stockings,” enumerated Katy.
</p>
<p>
“An’ de lady’s got di’monds on her—I seen
’em sparkle,” shouted Tony. “An’ de Whalen
kids is all fixed up, too,” he added. “An’, say,
dey’ve bringed home stuff an’ is showin’ ’em.
Gee! look at that sw-word!”
</p>
<p>
“An’ thar’s cake,” gurgled Katy. “Tony,
they’re eatin’ choc’late cake. Say, I <em>am</em> a-goin’
in!”
</p>
<p>
There was a sudden commotion about the
Whalens’ door. An undersized little body was
worming its way through the crowd, and thrusting
sharp little elbows to the right and to the
left. The next minute, Margaret Kendall, standing
near the Whalens’ table, felt an imperative
tug at her sleeve.
</p>
<p>
“Hullo! Say, Mag, give us a bite; will ye?”
</p>
<p>
“Katy! Why, it’s Katy Goldburg,” cried
Margaret in joyous recognition. “Mother, here’s
Katy.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
</p>
<p>
The first touch of Margaret’s hand on Katy’s
shoulder swept like an electric shock through the
waiting throng around the door. It was the signal
for a general onslaught. In a moment the
Whalen kitchen swarmed with boys, girls, and
women, all shouting, all talking at once, and all
struggling to reach the beautiful, blue-eyed,
golden-haired little girl they had known as “Mag
of the Alley.”
</p>
<p>
Step by step Margaret fell back until she was
quite against the wall. Her eyes grew wide and
terror-filled, yet she made a brave attempt to smile
and to respond politely to the noisy greetings.
Across the room Mrs. Kendall struggled to reach
her daughter’s side, but the onrushing tide of humanity
flung her back and left her helpless and
alone.
</p>
<p>
It was then that Mrs. Whalen’s powerful fist
and strident voice came to the rescue. In three
minutes the room was cleared, and Margaret was
sobbing in her mother’s arms.
</p>
<p>
“You see, mother, you see how ’tis,” she cried
hysterically, as soon as she could speak. “There’s
such lots and lots of them, and they’re all so poor.
Did you see how ragged and bad their clothes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
were, and how they grabbed for the cake? We’ve
got to divvy up, mother, we’ve got to divvy up!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dear, I know; and we will,” soothed Mrs.
Kendall, hurriedly. “We’ll begin right away to-morrow,
darling. But now we’ll go back to the
hotel and go to bed. My little girl is tired and
needs rest.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>
Dr. Spencer met Mrs. Kendall and her
daughter at the Houghtonsville station
on the night they returned from New
York. His lips were smiling, and his eyes were
joyous as befitted a lover who is to behold for the
first time in nine long days his dear one’s face.
The eager words of welcome died on his lips, however,
at sight of the weariness and misery in the
two dear faces before him.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Amy, dearest,” he began anxiously:
but her upraised hand silenced him.
</p>
<p>
“To-night—not now,” she murmured, with a
quick glance at Margaret. Then aloud to her
daughter she said: “See, dear, here’s Dr. Spencer,
and he’s brought the ponies to carry us home.
What a delightful drive we will have!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, has he?” For an instant Margaret’s face
glowed with animation; then the light died out
as suddenly as it had come. “But, mother, I—I
think I’d rather walk,” she said. “You know
Patty and the rest can’t ride.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
</p>
<p>
The doctor frowned, and gave a sudden exclamation
under his breath. Mrs. Kendall paled a
little and turned to her daughter.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I know,” she said gently. “But you are
very tired, and mother thinks it best you should
ride. After all, dearie, you know it won’t make
Patty and the rest ride, even if you do walk.
Don’t you see?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I—I suppose so,” admitted Margaret;
but she sighed as she climbed into the carriage,
and all the way home her eyes were troubled.
</p>
<p>
Not until after Margaret had gone to bed that
night did Mrs. Kendall answer the questions that
had trembled all the evening on the doctor’s lips;
then she told him the story of those nine days in
New York, beginning with Margaret’s visit to the
Alley, and her overwhelming “reception” in the
Whalens’ basement home.
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid the whole thing has been a mistake,”
she said despondently, when she had finished.
“Instead of making Margaret happy, it
has made her miserable.”
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t see,” protested the doctor. “As
near as I can make out you did just what she
wanted; you—er—‘divvied up.’”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kendall sighed.
</p>
<p>
“Why, of course, to a certain extent: but even
Margaret, child though she is, saw the hopelessness
of the task when once we set about it. There
were so many, so pitifully many. Her few weeks
of luxurious living here at home have opened her
eyes to the difference between her life and theirs,
and I thought the child would cry herself sick over
it all.”
</p>
<p>
“But you helped them—some of them?”
</p>
<p>
Again Mrs. Kendall sighed.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, oh, yes, we helped them. I think if Margaret
could have had her way we should have
marched through the streets to the tune of ‘See
the conquering hero comes,’ distributing new
dresses and frosted cakes with unstinted hands; but
I finally convinced her that such assistance was
perhaps not the wisest way of going about what
we wanted to do. At last I had to keep her away
from the Alley altogether, it affected her so. I got
her interested in looking up a new home for the
Whalens, and so filled her mind with that.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, then the Whalens have a new home?
Well, I’m sure Margaret must have liked that.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kendall smiled wearily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
“<em>Margaret</em> did,” she said; and at the emphasis
the doctor raised his eyebrows.
</p>
<p>
“But, surely the Whalens——”
</p>
<p>
“Did not,” supplied Mrs. Kendall.
</p>
<p>
“Did not!” cried the doctor.
</p>
<p>
“Well, ’twas this way,” laughed Mrs. Kendall.
“It was my idea to find a nice little place outside
the city where perhaps Mr. Whalen could raise
vegetables, and Mrs. Whalen do some sort of work
that paid better than flower-making. Perhaps
Margaret’s insistence upon ‘grass and trees’ influenced
me. At any rate, I found the place, and
in high feather told the Whalens of the good fortune
in store for them. What was my surprise to
be met with blank silence, save only one wild
whoop of glee from the children.
</p>
<p>
“‘An’ sure then, an’ it’s in the country; is it?’
Mrs. Whalen asked finally.
</p>
<p>
“‘Yes,’ I said. ‘With a yard, some flower beds,
and a big garden for vegetables.’ I was just
warming to my subject once more when Mr.
Whalen demanded, ‘Is it fur from the Alley?’
</p>
<p>
“Well, to make a long story short, they at last
kindly consented to view the place; but, after one
glance, they would have none of it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
</p>
<p>
“But—why?” queried the doctor.
</p>
<p>
“Various reasons. ’Twas lonesome; too far
from the Alley; they didn’t care to raise vegetables,
any way, and Mr. Whalen considered it quite
too much work to ‘kape up a place like that.’
According to my private opinion, however, the
man had an eye out for a saloon, and he didn’t
see it; consequently—the result!
</p>
<p>
“Well, we came back to town and the basement
kitchen. Margaret was inconsolable when she
heard the decision. The Whalen children, too,
were disappointed; but Mr. Whalen and his wife
were deaf to their entreaties. In the end I persuaded
them to move to rooms that at least had
the sun and air—though they were still in the
Alley—and there I left them with a well-stocked
larder and wardrobe, and with the rent paid six
months in advance. I shall keep my eye on them,
of course, for Margaret’s sake, and I hope to do
something really worth while for the children.
Patty and the twins are still with them at
present.”
</p>
<p>
“But wasn’t Margaret satisfied with that?” asked
the doctor.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, so far as it went: but there were still the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
others. Harry, that child has the whole Alley on
her heart. I’m at my wits’ end to know what to
do. You heard her this afternoon—she didn’t
want to ride home because Patty must walk in
New York. She looks askance at the frosting on
her cake, and questions her right to wear anything
but rags. Harry, what can I do?”
</p>
<p>
The man was silent.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, dear,” he said slowly, at last.
“We must think—and think hard. Hers is not a
common case. There is no precedent to determine
our course. Small girls of five that have
been reared in luxury are not often thrust into the
streets and sweat shops of a great city and there
forced to spend four years of their life—thank
God! That those four years should have had a tremendous
influence is certain. She can’t be the
same girl she would have been had she spent those
years at her mother’s knee. One thing is sure,
however, seems to me. In her present nervous
condition, if there is such a thing as getting her
mind off those four years of her life and everything
connected with it, it should be done.”
</p>
<p>
The doctor paused, and at that instant a step
sounded on the graveled driveway. A moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
later a boy’s face flashed into the light that
streamed through the open door.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Bobby, is that you?” cried Mrs. Kendall.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am, it’s me, please. Did Mag—I
mean Margaret come home, please?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, she came to-night.”
</p>
<p>
Bobby hesitated. He stood first on one foot,
then on the other. At last, very slowly he dragged
his right hand from behind his back.
</p>
<p>
“I been makin’ it for her,” he said, presenting
a small, but very elaborate basket composed of
peach-stones. “Mebbe if she ain’t—er—<em>are</em> not
awake, you’ll give it to her in the mornin’. Er—thank
ye. Much obliged. Good-evenin’, ma’am.”
And he turned and fled down the walk.
</p>
<p>
For a time there was silence on the veranda.
Mrs. Kendall was turning the basket over and
over in her hands. Suddenly she raised her head.
</p>
<p>
“You are right, Harry,” she sighed. “Her
mind must be taken off those four years of her
life, and off everything connected with it; everything
and—everybody.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” echoed the doctor; “everything and—everybody.
Er—let me see his basket, please.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
</p>
<p>
Four days later Mrs. Kendall and her daughter
Margaret left Houghtonsville for a month’s stay
in the White Mountains. From the rear window
of a certain law office in town a boy of fourteen
disconsolately watched the long train that was
rapidly bearing them out of sight.
</p>
<p>
“An’ I hain’t seen her but once since I give her
the basket,” he was muttering; “an’ then I couldn’t
speak to her—her mother whisked her off so quick.
Plague take that basket—wish’t I’d never see it!
An’ I worked so hard over it, ’cause she said she
liked ’em made out o’ peach-stones! She said
she did.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>
It was the day before Christmas. For eight
weeks Margaret had been at Elmhurst, Miss
Dole’s school in the Berkshires. School—Miss
Dole’s school—had been something of a surprise
to Margaret; and Margaret had been decidedly
a surprise to the school. Margaret was
not used to young misses who fared sumptuously
every day, and who yet complained because a
favorite ice cream or a pet kind of cake was not
always forthcoming; and Miss Dole’s pupils were
not used to a little girl who questioned their right
to be well-fed and well-clothed, and who supplemented
this questioning with distressing stories of
other little girls who had little to wear and less to
eat day after day, and week after week.
</p>
<p>
Margaret had not gone to Elmhurst without a
struggle on the part of her mother. To Mrs. Kendall
it seemed cruel to be separated so soon from
the little daughter who had but just been restored
to her hungry arms after four long years of almost
hopeless waiting. On the other hand, there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
Margaret’s own interests to be thought of. School,
certainly, was a necessity, unless there should be
a governess at home; and of this last Mrs. Kendall
did not approve. She particularly wished
Margaret to have the companionship of happy,
well-bred girls of her own age. The Houghtonsville
public school was hardly the place, in Mrs.
Kendall’s opinion, for a little maid with Margaret’s
somewhat peculiar ideas as to matters and things.
There was Bobby, too—Bobby, the constant reminder
in word and deed of the city streets and
misery that Mrs. Kendall particularly wished forgotten.
Yes, there certainly was Bobby to be
thought of—and to be avoided. It was because
of all this, therefore, that Margaret had been sent
to Elmhurst. She had gone there straight from the
great hotel in the mountains, where she and her
mother had been spending a few weeks; so she
had not seen Houghtonsville since September. It
was the Christmas vacation now, and she was going
back—back to the house with the stone lions
and the big play room where had lain for so long
the little woolly dog of her babyhood.
</p>
<p>
It was not of the stone lions, nor the play room
that Margaret was thinking, however; it was of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
something much more important and more—delightful,
the girls said. At all events, it was wonderfully
exciting, and promised all sorts of charming
possibilities in the way of music, pretty clothes,
and good things to eat—again according to the
girls.
</p>
<p>
It was a wedding.
</p>
<p>
Margaret’s idea of marriage had undergone a
decided change in the last few weeks. The envious
delight of the girls over the fact that she was
to be so intimately connected with a wedding,
together with their absorbing interest in every
detail, had been far more convincing than all of
Mrs. Kendall’s anxious teachings: marriage might
not be such a calamity, after all.
</p>
<p>
It had come as somewhat of a shock to Margaret—this
envious delight of her companions.
She had looked upon her mother’s marriage as
something to be deplored; something to be tolerated,
to be sure, since for some unaccountable
reason her mother wanted it; but, still nevertheless
an evil. There was the contract, to be sure,
and the doctor had signed it without a murmur;
but Margaret doubted the efficacy of even that at
times—it would take something more than a contract,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
certainly, if the doctor should prove to be
anything like Mike Whalen for a husband.
</p>
<p>
The doctor would not be like Mike Whalen,
however—so the girls said. They had never seen
any husbands that were like him, for that matter.
They knew nothing whatever about husbands that
shook and beat their wives and banged them
around. All this they declared unhesitatingly,
and with no little indignation in response to
Margaret’s somewhat doubting questions. There
were the story-books, too. The girls all had them,
and each book was full of fair ladies and brave
knights, and of beautiful princesses who married
the king—and who wanted to marry him, too,
and who would have felt very badly if they could
not have married him!
</p>
<p>
In the face of so overwhelming an array of evidence,
Margaret almost lost her fears—marriage
might be very desirable, after all. And so it was
a very happy little girl that left Elmhurst on the
day before Christmas and, in care of one of the
teachers, journeyed toward Houghtonsville, where
were waiting the play room, the great stone lions,
and the wonderful wedding, to say nothing of the
dear loving mother herself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>

<p>
It was not quite the same Margaret that had
left Houghtonsville a few months before. Even
those short weeks had not been without their influence.
</p>
<p>
Margaret, in accordance with Mrs. Kendall’s
urgent request, had been the special charge of
every teacher at Elmhurst; and every teacher
knew the story of the little girl’s life, as well as
just what they all had now to battle against.
Everything that was good and beautiful was kept
constantly before her eyes, and so far as was
possible, everything that was the reverse of all
this was kept from her sight, and from being discussed
in her presence. She learned of wonderful
countries across the sea, and of the people
who lived in them. She studied about high
mountains and great rivers, and she was shown
pictures of kings and queens and palaces. Systematically
and persistently she was led along a
way that did not know the Alley, and that did
not recognize that there was in the world any
human creature who was poor, or sick, or
hungry.
</p>
<p>
It is little wonder, then, that she came to question
less and less the luxury all about her; that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
she wore the pretty dresses and dainty shoes, and
ate the food provided, with a resignation that was
strangely like content; and that she talked less
and less of Patty, the twins, and the Alley.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>
Christmas was a wonderful day at Five
Oaks, certainly to Margaret. First there
was the joy of skipping, bare-toed, across
the room to where the long black stockings hung
from the mantel. In the gray dawn of the early
morning its bulging knobbiness looked delightfully
mysterious; and never were presents half so
entrancing as those drawn from its black depths
by Margaret’s small eager fingers.
</p>
<p>
Later in the morning came the sleigh-ride behind
the doctor’s span of bays, and then there was
the delicious dinner followed by the games and
the frolics and the quiet hour with mother. Still
later the house began to fill with guests and then
came the wedding, with Mrs. Kendall all in soft
gray and looking radiantly happy on the doctor’s
arm.
</p>
<p>
It was a simple ceremony and soon over, and
then came the long line of beaming friends and
neighbors to wish the bride and groom joy and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
God-speed. Margaret, standing a little apart by
the dining-room door, felt a sudden pull at her
sleeve. She turned quickly and looked straight
into Bobby McGinnis’s eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Bobby, why, Bobby!” she welcomed joyously;
but Bobby put his finger to his lips.
</p>
<p>
“Sh-h!” he cautioned; then, peremptorily,
“Come.” And he led the way through the deserted
dining-room to a little room off the sidehall
where the gloom made his presence almost
indiscernible. “There!” he sighed in relief. “I
fetched ye, didn’t I?”
</p>
<p>
Margaret frowned.
</p>
<p>
“But, Bobby,” she remonstrated, “why—what
are you doing out here, all in the dark?”
</p>
<p>
“Seein’ you.”
</p>
<p>
“Seeing me! But I was in there, where ’twas
all light and pretty, and you could see me lots better
there!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but I wa’n’t there,” retorted Bobby,
grimly; then he added: “‘Twa’n’t my party, ye
see, an’ I wa’n’t invited. But I wanted ter see ye—an’
I did, too.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret was silent.
</p>
<p>
“Mebbe ye want ter go back now yerself,” observed Bobby,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
gloomily, after a time. “’Tain’t so
pretty here, I’ll own.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret did want to go back, and she almost
said so, but something in the boy’s voice silenced
the words on her lips.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ll stay, ‘course,” she murmured, shifting
about uneasily on her little white-slippered feet.
</p>
<p>
Bobby roused himself.
</p>
<p>
“Here, take a chair,” he proposed, pushing
toward her a low stool; “an’ I’ll set here on the
winder sill. Nice night; ain’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ’tis.” Margaret sat down, carefully
spreading her skirts.
</p>
<p>
There was a long silence. Through the half-open
door came a shaft of light and the sound of
distant voices. Bobby was biting his finger nails,
and Margaret was wondering just how she could get
back to the drawing-room without hurting the feelings
of her unbidden guest. At last the boy spoke.
</p>
<p>
“Mebbe when we’re grown up we’ll get married,
too,” he blurted out, saying the one thing he had
intended not to say. He bit his tongue angrily,
but the next minute he almost fell off the window
sill in his amazement—the little girl had sprung to
her feet and clapped her hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
“Bobby, could we?” she cried.
</p>
<p>
“Sure!” rejoined Bobby with easy nonchalance.
“Why not?”
</p>
<p>
“And there’d be flowers and music and lots of
people to see us?”
</p>
<p>
“Heaps!” promised Bobby.
</p>
<p>
“Oh-h!” sighed Margaret ecstatically. “And
then we’ll go traveling ‘way over to London and
Paris and Egypt and see the Alps.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh?” The voice of the prospective young
bridegroom sounded a little uncertain.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll go traveling to see things, you know,”
reiterated Margaret. “There’s such a lot of things
I want to see.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, we’ll go travelin’,” assured Bobby,
promptly, wondering all the while if he could remember
just where his mother’s geography was.
He should have need of it after he got home that
night. London, Paris, Egypt, and the Alps—it
might be well to look up the way to get there, at
all events.
</p>
<p>
“I think maybe now I’ll go back,” said Margaret,
with sudden stiffness. “They might be
looking for me. Good-bye.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I say, Maggie,” called Bobby, eagerly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
“when folks is engaged they——” But only the
swish of white skirts answered him, and there was
nothing for him to do but disconsolately to let himself
out the side door before any one came and
found him.
</p>
<p>
“And I’m going to get married, too,” said Margaret
to her mother half an hour later.
</p>
<p>
“You’re going to get married!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; to Bobby, you know.”
</p>
<p>
The newly-made bride sat down suddenly, and
threw a quick look at her husband.
</p>
<p>
“To Bobby!” she exclaimed. “Why, when—where—Bobby
wasn’t here.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” smiled Margaret. “He said he wasn’t
invited, but he came. We fixed it all up a little
while ago. We’re going to London and Paris and
Egypt and see the Alps.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>
The great dining-room at Hilcrest, the old
Spencer homestead, was perhaps the
pleasantest room in the house. The
house itself crowned the highest hill that overlooked
the town, and its dining-room windows and the
veranda without, commanded a view of the river
for miles, just where the valley was the greenest
and the most beautiful. On the other side of the
veranda which ran around three sides of the house,
one might see the town with its myriad roofs and
tall chimneys; but although these same tall chimneys
represented the wealth that made possible the
great Spencer estate, yet it was the side of the
veranda overlooking the green valley that was the
most popular with the family. It was said, to be
sure, that old Jacob Spencer, who built the house,
and who laid the foundations for the Spencer
millions, had preferred the side that overlooked the
town; and that he spent long hours gloating over
the visible results of his thrift and enterprise. But
old Jacob was dead now, and his son’s sons reigned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
instead; and his son’s sons, no matter how much
they might value the whiz and whir and smoke of
the town, preferred, when at rest, to gaze upon
green hills and far-reaching meadows. This was,
indeed, typical of the Spencer code—the farther
away they could get from the oil that made the
machinery of life run easily and noiselessly, the
better pleased they were.
</p>
<p>
The dining-room looked particularly pleasant
this July evening. A gentle breeze stirred the
curtains at the open windows, and the setting sun
peeped through the vines outside and glistened
on the old family plate. Three generations of
Spencers looked down from the walls on the two
men and the woman sitting at the great mahogany
table. The two men and the woman, however,
were not looking at the sunlight, the vines, or the
swaying curtains; they were looking at each
other, and their eyes were troubled and questioning.
</p>
<p>
“You say she is coming next week?” asked
the younger man, glancing at the letter in the
other’s hand.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Tuesday afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Frank, this is so—sudden,” remonstrated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
the young fellow, laughing a little as he uttered
the trite phrase. “How does it happen that I’ve
heard so little of this young lady who is to be
so unceremoniously dropped into our midst next
Tuesday?”
</p>
<p>
Frank Spencer made an impatient gesture that
showed how great was his perturbation.
</p>
<p>
“Come, come, Ned, don’t be foolish,” he protested.
“You know very well that your brother’s
stepdaughter has been my ward for a dozen
years.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but that is all I know,” rejoined the
young man, quietly. “I have never seen her,
and scarcely ever heard of her, and yet you
expect me to take as a matter of course this
strange young woman who is none of our kith
nor kin, and yet who is to be one of us from
henceforth forevermore!”
</p>
<p>
“The boy is right,” interposed the low voice of
the woman across the table. “Ned doesn’t know
anything about her. He was a mere child himself
when it all happened, and he’s been away
from home most of the time since. For that matter,
we don’t know much about her ourselves.”
</p>
<p>
“We certainly don’t,” sighed Frank Spencer;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
then he raised his head and squared his shoulders.
“See here, good people, this will never do
in the world,” he asserted with sudden authority.
“I have offered the hospitality of this house to a
homeless, orphan girl, and she has accepted it.
There is nothing for us to do now but to try to
make her happy. After all, we needn’t worry—it
may turn out that she will make us happy.”
</p>
<p>
“But what is she? How does she look?” catechized
Ned.
</p>
<p>
His brother shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” he replied simply.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know! But, surely you have seen
her!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, oh, yes, I have seen her, once or twice,
but Margaret Kendall is not a girl whom to see
is to know; besides, the circumstances were such
that—well, I might as well tell the story from the
beginning, particularly as you know so little of it
yourself.”
</p>
<p>
Frank paused, and looked at the letter in his
hand. After a minute he laid it gently down.
When he spoke his voice was not quite steady.
</p>
<p>
“Our brother Harry was a physician, as you
know, Ned. You were twelve years old when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
married a widow by the name of Kendall who
lived in Houghtonsville where he had been practising.
As it chanced, none of us went to the
wedding. You were taken suddenly ill, and
neither Della nor myself would leave you, and
father was in Bermuda that winter for his health.
Mrs. Kendall had a daughter, Margaret, about
ten years old, who was at school somewhere in
the Berkshires. It was to that school that I went
when the terrible news came that Harry and his
new wife had lost their lives in that awful railroad
accident. That was the first time that I saw
Margaret.
</p>
<p>
“The poor child was, of course, heartbroken
and inconsolable; but her grief took a peculiar
turn. The mere sight of me drove her almost
into hysterics. She would have nothing whatever
to do with me, or with any of her stepfather’s
people. She reasoned that if her mother had not
married, there would have been no wedding journey;
and if there had been no wedding journey
there would have been no accident, and that her
mother would then have been alive, and well.
</p>
<p>
“Arguments, pleadings, and entreaties were in
vain. She would not listen to me, or even see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
me. She held her hands before her face and
screamed if I so much as came into the room.
She was nothing but a child, of course, and not
even a normal one at that, for she had had a very
strange life. At five she was lost in New York
City, and for four years she lived on the streets
and in the sweat shops, enduring almost unbelievable
poverty and hardships.”
</p>
<p>
“By Jove!” exclaimed Ned under his breath.
</p>
<p>
“It was only seven or eight months before the
wedding that she was found,” went on Frank,
“and of course the influence of the wild life she
had led was still with her more or less, and made
her not easily subject to control. There was
nothing for me to do but to leave the poor little
thing where she was, particularly as there seemed
to be no other place for her. She would not
come with me, and she had no people of her
own to whom she could turn for love and sympathy.
</p>
<p>
“As you know, poor Harry was conscious for
some hours after the accident, long enough to
make his will and dictate the letter to me, leaving
Margaret to my care—boy though I was. I was
only twenty, you see; but, really, there was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
one else to whom he could leave her. That was
something over thirteen years ago. Margaret
must be about twenty-three now.”
</p>
<p>
“And you’ve not seen her since?” There was
keen reproach in Ned’s voice.
</p>
<p>
Frank smiled.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I’ve seen her twice,” he replied. “And
of course I’ve written to her many times, and have
always kept in touch with those she was with.
She stayed at the Berkshire school five years;
then—with some fear and trembling, I own—I
went to see her. I found a grave-eyed little miss
who answered my questions with studied politeness,
and who agreed without comment to the
proposition that I place her in a school where she
might remain until she was ready for college—should
she elect to go to college.”
</p>
<p>
“But her vacations—did she never come then?”
questioned Ned.
</p>
<p>
“No. At first I did not ask her, of course. It
was out of the question, as she was feeling. Some
one of her teachers always looked out for her.
They all pitied her, and naturally did everything
they could for her, as did her mates at school.
Later, when I did dare to ask her to come here,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
she always refused. She wrote me stiff little notes
in which she informed me that she was to spend
the holidays with some Blanche or Dorothy or
Mabel of her acquaintance.
</p>
<p>
“She was nineteen when I saw her again. I
found now a charming, graceful girl, with peculiarly
haunting blue eyes, and heavy coils of
bronze-gold hair that kinked and curled about
her little pink ears in a most distracting fashion.
Even now, though, she would not come to my
home. She was going abroad with friends. The
party included an irreproachable chaperon, so of
course I had nothing to say; while as for money—she
had all of her mother’s not inconsiderable
fortune besides everything that had been her stepfather’s;
so of course there was no question on
that score.
</p>
<p>
“In the fall she entered college, and there she
has been ever since, spending her vacations as
usual with friends, generally traveling. When
she came of age she specially requested me to
make no change in her affairs, but to regard herself
as my ward for the present, just as she had
been. So I still call myself her guardian. This
June was her graduation. I had forgotten the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
fact until I received the little engraved invitation
a week or two ago. I thought of running down
for it, but I couldn’t get away very well, and—well,
I didn’t go, that’s all. But I did write and
ask her to make this house her home, and here is
her reply. She thanks me, and will come next
Tuesday. There! now you have it. You know
all that I do.” And Frank Spencer leaned back
in his chair with a long sigh.
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t know yet what she’s like,” objected
Ned.
</p>
<p>
“Neither do I.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but you’ve seen her.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; and how? Do you suppose that those
two or three meetings were very illuminating?
No. I’ve been told this, however,” he added.
“It seems that immediately after her return to
her mother’s home she had the most absurd
quixotic notions about sharing all she had with
every ragamuffin in New York. She even carried
her distress over their condition to such an
extent that her mother really feared for her reason.
All her teachers, therefore, were instructed to keep
from her all further knowledge of poverty and
trouble; and particularly to instil into her mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
the fact that there was really in the world a great
deal of pleasure and happiness.”
</p>
<p>
Over across the table Mrs. Merideth shivered a
little.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me!” she sighed. “I do hope the child
is well over those notions. I shouldn’t want her
to mix up here with the mill people. I never did
quite like those settlement women, anyway, and
only think what might happen with one in one’s
own family!”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think I should worry, sister sweet,”
laughed Frank. “I haven’t seen much of the
young lady, but I think I have seen enough for
that. I fancy the teachers succeeded in their mission.
As near as I can judge, Miss Margaret
Kendall does not resemble your dreaded ‘settlement
worker’ in the least. However, we’ll wait
and see.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>
There was something of the precision of
clockwork in matters and things at Hilcrest.
A large corps of well-trained
servants in charge of an excellent housekeeper
left Mrs. Merideth free to go, and come, and entertain
as she liked. For fifteen years now she
had been mistress of Hilcrest, ever since her
mother had died, in fact. Widowed herself at
twenty-two after a year of married life, and the
only daughter in a family of four children, she had
been like a second mother to her two younger
brothers. Harry, the eldest brother, had early
left the home roof to study medicine. Frank,
barely twenty when his brother Harry lost his life,
had even then pleased his father by electing the
mills as his life-work. And now, five years after
that father’s death, Ned was sharing his brother
Frank’s care and responsibility in keeping the
great wheels turning and the great chimneys
smoking in the town below.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
</p>
<p>
Della Merideth was essentially a woman who liked—and
who usually obtained—the strawberries and
cream of life. Always accustomed to luxury, she
demanded as a matter of course rich clothing and
dainty food. That there were people in the world
whose clothing was coarse and whose food was
scanty, she well knew; and knowing this she was
careful that her donations to the Home Missionary
Society and the Woman’s Guild were prompt and
liberal. Beyond this her duty did not extend, she
was sure. As for any personal interest in the recipients
of her alms, she had none whatever; and
would, indeed, have deemed it both unnecessary
and unladylike that she should have had such
interest. Her eyes were always on the hills and
meadows on the west side of the house, and even
her way to and from Hilcrest was carefully
planned so that she might avoid so far as was
possible, the narrow, ill-smelling streets of the
town on the other side of the hill.
</p>
<p>
Frank Spencer was a hard-headed, far-seeing
man of business—inside the office of Spencer &amp;
Spencer; outside, he was a delightful gentleman—a
little grave, perhaps, for his thirty-three years,
but none the less a favorite, particularly with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
anxious mothers having marriageable, but rather
light-headed, daughters on their hands. His eyes
were brown, his nose was straight and long, and
his mouth firm and clean-cut. His whole appearance
was that of a man sure of himself—and of
others. To Frank Spencer the vast interests of
Spencer &amp; Spencer, as represented by the huge
mills that lined the river bank, were merely one
big machine; and the hundreds of men, women,
and children that dragged their weary way in and
out the great doors were but so many cogs in the
wheels. That the cogs had hearts that ached and
heads that throbbed did not occur to him. He
was interested only in the smooth and silent running
of the wheels themselves.
</p>
<p>
Ned was the baby of the house. In spite of his
length of limb and breadth of shoulder he was
still looked upon by his brother and sister as little
more than a boy. School, college, and a year of
travel had trained his brain, toughened his muscles,
and browned his skin, and left him full of
enthusiasm for his chosen work, which just now
meant helping to push Spencer &amp; Spencer to the
top notch of power and prosperity.
</p>
<p>
For five years the two brothers and the widowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
sister in the great house that crowned Prospect
Hill, had been by themselves save for the servants
and the occasional guests—and the Spencers were
a clannish family, so people said. However that
might have been, there certainly was not one of
the three that was not conscious of a vague fear
and a well-defined regret, whenever there came
the thought of this strange young woman who
was so soon to enter their lives.
</p>
<p>
To be a Spencer was to be hospitable, however,
and the preparations for the expected guest were
prompt and generous. By Tuesday the entire
house, even to its inmates, was ready with a cordial
welcome for the orphan girl.
</p>
<p>
In his big touring car Frank Spencer went to
the station to meet his ward. With him was Mrs.
Merideth, and her eyes, fully as anxiously as his,
swept the crowd of passengers alighting from the
long train. Almost simultaneously they saw the
tall young woman in gray; and Mrs. Merideth
sighed with relief as Frank gave a quick exclamation
and hurried forward.
</p>
<p>
“At least she looks like a lady,” Mrs. Merideth
murmured, as she followed her brother.
</p>
<p>
“You are Margaret Kendall, I am sure,” Frank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
was saying; and Mrs. Merideth saw the light leap
to the girl’s eyes as she gave him her hand.
</p>
<p>
“And you are Mr. Spencer, my guardian—‘Uncle
Frank.’ Am I still to call you ‘Uncle
Frank’?” Mrs. Merideth heard a clear voice say.
The next moment she found herself looking into
what she instantly thought were the most wonderful
eyes she had ever seen.
</p>
<p>
“And I am Mrs. Merideth, my dear—‘Aunt
Della,’ I hope,” she said gently, before her brother
could speak.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you; and it will be ‘Aunt Della,’ I’m
sure,” smiled the girl; and again Mrs. Merideth
marveled at the curious charm of the eyes that
met her own.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>
The big touring car skirted the edge of
the town, avoiding as usual the narrower
streets, and turning as soon as possible
into a wide, elm-bordered avenue.
</p>
<p>
“We have to climb to reach Hilcrest,” called
Frank over his shoulder, as the car began a steep
ascent.
</p>
<p>
“Then you must have a view as a reward,” rejoined
Margaret.
</p>
<p>
“We do,” declared Mrs. Merideth,—“but not
here,” she laughed, as the car plunged into the
depths of a miniature forest.
</p>
<p>
It was a silent drive, in the main. The man in
front had the car to guide. The two women in
the tonneau dropped an occasional word, but for
the most part their eyes were fixed on bird or
flower, or on the shifting gleams of sunlight
through the trees. The very fact that there was
no constraint in this silence argued well for the
place the orphan girl had already found in the
hearts of her two companions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
Not until the top of the hill was reached, and
the car swung around the broad curve of the
driveway, did the full beauty of the panorama before
her burst on Margaret’s eyes. She gave a
low cry of delight.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how beautiful—how wonderfully, wonderfully
beautiful!” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
Her eyes were on the silver sheen of the river
trailing along the green velvet of the valley far
below—she had turned her back on the red-roofed
town with its smoking chimneys.
</p>
<p>
The sun was just setting when a little later she
walked across the lawn to where a rustic seat
marked the abrupt descent of the hill. Far below
the river turned sharply. On the left it
flowed through a cañon of many-windowed walls,
and under a pall of smoke. On the right it
washed the shores of flowering meadows, and
mirrored the sunset sky in its depths.
</p>
<p>
So absorbed was Margaret in the beauty of the
scene that she did not notice the figure of a man
coming up the winding path at her left. Even
Ned Spencer himself did not see the girl until he
was almost upon her. Then he stopped short,
his lips breaking into a noiseless “Well, by Jove!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
</p>
<p>
A twig snapped under his foot at his next step,
and the girl turned.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it’s you,” she said absorbedly. “I couldn’t
wait. I came right out to see it,” she finished,
her eyes once more on the valley below. The
brothers, at first glance, looked wonderfully alike,
and Margaret had unhesitatingly taken Ned to be
Frank.
</p>
<p>
Ned did not speak. He, too, like his sister an
hour before, had fallen under the spell of a pair of
wondrous blue eyes.
</p>
<p>
“It seems to me,” said the girl, slowly, “that
nothing in the world would ever trouble me if I
had that to look at.”
</p>
<p>
“It seems so to me, too,” agreed Ned—but he
was not looking at the view.
</p>
<p>
The girl turned sharply. She gave a little cry
of dismay. The embarrassed red flew to her
cheeks.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you—you are not Uncle Frank at all!”
she stammered.
</p>
<p>
A sudden light of comprehension broke over
Ned’s face. And so this was Margaret. How
stupid of him not to have known at once!
</p>
<p>
He laughed lightly and made a low bow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
</p>
<p>
“I have not that honor,” he confessed. “But
you—you must be Miss Kendall.”
</p>
<p>
“And you?”
</p>
<p>
“I?” Ned smiled quizzically. “I? Oh, I am—your
<em>Uncle</em> Ned!” he announced; and his voice
and his emphasis told her that he fully appreciated
his privilege in being twenty-five—and uncle to a
niece of twenty-three.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>
By the end of the month the family at Hilcrest
wondered how they had ever lived
before they saw the world and everything
in it through the blue eyes of Margaret Kendall—the
world and everything in it seemed so much
more beautiful now!
</p>
<p>
Never were the long mornings in the garden
or on the veranda so delightful to Mrs. Merideth
as now with a bright, sympathetic girl to laugh,
chat, or keep silent as the whim of the moment
dictated; and never were the summer evenings so
charming to Frank as now when one might lie
back in one’s chair or hammock and listen to a
dreamy nocturne or a rippling waltz-song, and
realize that the musician was no bird of passage,
but that she was one’s own beloved ward and was
even now at home. As for Ned—never were the
golf links in so fine a shape, nor the tennis court
and croquet ground so alluring; and never had he
known before how many really delightful trips
there were within a day’s run for his motor-car.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
</p>
<p>
And yet——
</p>
<p>
“Della, do you think Margaret is happy?”
asked Frank one day, as he and his sister and
Ned were watching the sunset from the west veranda.
Margaret had gone into the house, pleading
a headache as an excuse for leaving them.
</p>
<p>
Della was silent. It was Ned who answered,
indignantly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Frank, of course she’s happy!”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not so—sure,” hesitated Frank. Then
Mrs. Merideth spoke.
</p>
<p>
“She’s happy, yes; but she’s—restless.”
</p>
<p>
Frank leaned forward.
</p>
<p>
“That’s it exactly,” he declared with conviction.
“She’s restless—and what’s the matter?
That’s what I want to know.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense! it’s just high spirits,” cut in Ned,
with an impatient gesture. “Margaret’s perfectly
happy. Doesn’t she laugh and sing and motor
and play tennis all day?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” retorted his brother, “she does; but behind
it all there’s a curious something that I can’t
get at. It is as if she were—were trying to get
away from something—something within herself.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Merideth nodded her head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
</p>
<p>
“I know,” she said. “I’ve seen it, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, you have!” Frank turned to his sister
with a troubled frown. “Well, what is it?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know.” Mrs. Merideth paused, her
eyes on the distant sky-line. “I have thought—once
or twice,” she resumed slowly, “that Margaret
might be—in love.”
</p>
<p>
“In love!” cried two voices in shocked amazement.
</p>
<p>
Had Mrs. Merideth been observant she might
have seen the sudden paling of a smooth-shaven
face, and the quick clinching of a strong white
hand that rested on the arm of a chair near her;
but she was not observant—in this case, at least—and
she went on quietly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but on the whole I’m inclined to doubt
that now.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you are,” laughed Ned, a little nervously.
His brother did not speak.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” repeated Mrs. Merideth; “but I haven’t
decided yet what it is.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I for one don’t believe it’s anything,”
declared Ned, stubbornly. “To me she seems
happy, and I believe she is.”
</p>
<p>
Frank shook his head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
“No,” he said. “By her own confession she
has been flitting from one place to another all
over the world; and, though perhaps she does not
realize it herself, I believe her coming here was
merely another effort on her part to get away
from this something—this something that while
within herself, perhaps, is none the less pursuing
her, and making her restless and unhappy.”
</p>
<p>
“But what can it be?” argued Ned. “She’s
not so different from other girls—only nicer. She
likes good times and pretty clothes, and is always
ready for any fun that’s going. I’m sure it isn’t
anything about those socialistic notions that Della
used to worry about,” he added laughingly.
“She’s got well over those—if she ever had them,
indeed. I don’t believe she’s looked toward the
mills since she’s been here—much less wanted to
know anything about the people that work in
them!”
</p>
<p>
“No, it isn’t that,” agreed Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps it isn’t anything,” broke in Della,
with sudden cheeriness. “Maybe it is a little dull
here for her after all her gay friends and interesting
travels. Perhaps she is a little homesick, but
is trying to make us think everything is all right,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
and she overdoes it. Anyway, we’ll ask some
nice people up for a week or two. I fancy we all
need livening up. We’re getting morbid. Come,
whom shall we have?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>
It had been a particularly delightful day with
the Hilcrest house-party. They had gone
early in the morning to Silver Lake for a
picnic. A sail on the lake, a delicious luncheon,
and a climb up “Hilltop” had filled every hour
with enjoyment until five o’clock when they had
started for home.
</p>
<p>
Two of the guests had brought their own
motor-cars to Hilcrest, and it was in one of these
that Miss Kendall was making the homeward
trip.
</p>
<p>
“And you call this a ‘runabout,’ Mr. Brandon?”
she laughed gaily, as the huge car darted
forward. “I should as soon think of having an
elephant for an errand boy.”
</p>
<p>
Brandon laughed.
</p>
<p>
“But just wait until you see the elephant get
over the ground,” he retorted. “And, after all,
the car isn’t so big when you compare it with
Harlow’s or Frank’s. It only seats two, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
know, but its engine is quite as powerful as either
of theirs. I want you to see what it can do,” he
finished, as he began gradually to increase their
speed.
</p>
<p>
For some time neither spoke. The road ran
straight ahead in a narrowing band of white that
lost itself in a thicket of green far in the distance.
Yet almost immediately—it seemed to Margaret—the
green was at their right and their left, and the
road had unwound another white length of ribbon
that flung itself across the valley and up the opposite
hill to the sky-line.
</p>
<p>
Houses, trees, barns, and bushes rushed by like
specters, and the soft August air swept by her
cheeks like a November gale. Not until the opposite
hill was reached, however, did Brandon
slacken speed.
</p>
<p>
“You see,” he exulted, “we can just annihilate
space with this!”
</p>
<p>
“You certainly can,” laughed Margaret, a little
hysterically. “And you may count yourself lucky
if you don’t annihilate anything else.”
</p>
<p>
Brandon brought the car almost to a stop.
</p>
<p>
“I was a brute. I frightened you,” he cried
with quick contrition.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p>
The girl shook her head. A strange light came
to her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“No; I liked it,” she answered. “I liked it—too
well. Do you know? I never dare to run a
car by myself—very much. I learned how, and
had a little runabout of my own at college, and I
run one now sometimes. But it came over me
one day—the power there was under my fingers.
Almost involuntarily I began to let it out. I went
faster and faster—and yet I did not go half fast
enough. Something seemed to be pushing me
on, urging me to even greater and greater speed.
I wanted to get away, away——! Then I came
to myself. I was miles from where I should have
been, and in a locality I knew nothing about. I
had no little difficulty in getting back to where I
belonged, besides having a fine or two to pay, I
believe. I was frightened and ashamed, for everywhere
I heard of stories of terrified men, women,
children, and animals, and of how I had narrowly
escaped having death itself to answer for as a result
of my mad race through the country. And yet—even
now—to-day, I felt that wild exhilaration of
motion. I did not want to stop. I wanted to go
on and on——” She paused suddenly, and fell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
back in her seat. “You see,” she laughed with a
complete change of manner, “I am not to be
trusted as a chauffeur.”
</p>
<p>
“I see,” nodded Brandon, a little soberly; then,
with a whimsical smile: “Perhaps I should want
the brakes shifted to my side of the car—if I rode
with you!... But, after all, when you come
right down to the solid comfort of motoring, you
can take it best by jogging along like this at a
good sensible rate of speed that will let you see
something of the country you are passing through.
Look at those clouds. We shall have a gorgeous
sunset to-night.”
</p>
<p>
It was almost an hour later that Brandon stopped
his car where two roads crossed, and looked behind
him.
</p>
<p>
“By George, where are those people?” he
queried.
</p>
<p>
“But we started first, and we came rapidly for
a time,” reminded the girl.
</p>
<p>
“I know, but we’ve been simply creeping for the
last mile or two,” returned the man. “I slowed up
purposely to fall in behind the rest. I’m not so sure
I know the way from here—but perhaps you do.”
And he turned his eyes questioningly to hers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not I,” she laughed. “But I thought you
did.”
</p>
<p>
“So did I,” he grumbled. “I’ve been over this
road enough in times past. Oh, I can get back
to Hilcrest all right,” he added reassuringly.
“It’s only that I don’t remember which is the best
way. One road takes us through the town and
is not so pleasant. I wanted to avoid that if possible.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind; let’s go on,” proposed the girl.
“It’s getting late, and we might miss them even
if we waited. They may have taken another road
farther back. If they thought you knew the way
they wouldn’t feel in duty bound to keep track of
us, and they may have already reached home. I
don’t mind a bit which road we take.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” acquiesced Brandon. “Just as you
say. I think this is the one. Anyhow, we’ll try
it.” And he turned his car to the left.
</p>
<p>
The sun had dipped behind the hills, and the
quick chill of an August evening was in the air.
Margaret shivered and reached for her coat. The
road wound in and out through a scrubby growth
of trees, then turned sharply and skirted the base
of a steep hill. Beyond the next turn it dropped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
in a gentle descent and ran between wide open
fields. A house appeared, then another and another.
A man and a woman walked along the
edge of the road and stopped while the automobile
passed. The houses grew more frequent, and
children and small dogs scurried across the road
to a point of safety.
</p>
<p>
“By George, I believe we’ve got the wrong
road now,” muttered Brandon with a frown.
“Shall we go back?”
</p>
<p>
“No, no,” demurred the girl. “What does it
matter? It’s only another way around, and perhaps
no longer than the other.”
</p>
<p>
The road turned and dropped again. The hill
was steeper now. The air grew heavy and fanned
Margaret’s cheek with a warm breath as if from an
oven. Unconsciously she loosened the coat at
her throat.
</p>
<p>
“Why, how warm it is!” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I fancy there’s no doubt now where
we are,” frowned Brandon. “I thought as
much,” he finished as the car swung around a
curve.
</p>
<p>
Straight ahead the road ran between lines of
squat brown houses with men, women, and children swarming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
on the door-steps or hanging on
the fences. Beyond rose tier upon tier of red and
brown roofs flanked on the left by the towering
chimneys of the mills. Still farther beyond and a
little to the right, just where the sky was reddest,
rose the terraced slopes of Prospect Hill crowned
by the towers and turrets of Hilcrest.
</p>
<p>
“We can at least see where we want to be,”
laughed Brandon. “Fine old place—shows up
great against that sky; doesn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
The girl at his side did not answer. Her eyes
had widened a little, and her cheeks had lost their
bright color. She was not looking at the pile of
brick and stone on top of Prospect Hill, but at the
ragged little urchins and pallid women that fell
back from the roadway before the car. The boys
yelled derisively, and a baby cried. Margaret
shrank back in her seat, and Brandon, turning
quickly, saw the look on her face. His own jaw
set into determined lines.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll be out of this soon, Miss Kendall,” he
assured her. “You mustn’t mind them. As if it
wasn’t bad enough to come here anyway but that
I must needs come now just when the day-shift is
getting home!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
</p>
<p>
“The day-shift?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; the hands who work days, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“But don’t they all work—days?”
</p>
<p>
Brandon laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Hardly!”
</p>
<p>
“You mean, they work <em>nights</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.” He threw a quizzical smile into her
startled eyes. “By the way,” he observed,
“you’d better not ask Frank in that tone of
voice if they work nights. That night-shift is a
special pet of his. He says it’s one great secret
of the mills’ prosperity—having two shifts. Not
that his are the only mills that run nights, of
course—there are plenty more.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret’s lips parted, but before she could
speak there came a hoarse shout and a quick cry
of terror. The next instant the car under Brandon’s
skilful hands swerved sharply and just
avoided a collision with a boy on a bicycle.
</p>
<p>
“Narrow shave, that,” muttered Brandon.
“He wasn’t even looking where he was going.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret shuddered. She turned her gaze to
the right and to the left. Everywhere were wan
faces and sunken eyes. With a little cry she
clutched Brandon’s arm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
</p>
<p>
“Can’t we go faster—faster,” she moaned. “I
want to get away—away!”
</p>
<p>
For answer came the sharp “honk-honk” of
the horn, and the car bounded forward. With a
shout the crowd fell back, and with another “honk-honk”
Brandon took the first turn to the right.
</p>
<p>
“I think we’re out of the worst of it,” he cried
in Margaret’s ear. “If we keep to the right, we’ll
go through only the edge of the town.” Even as
he spoke, the way cleared more and more before
them, and the houses grew farther apart.
</p>
<p>
The town was almost behind them, and their
speed had considerably lessened, when Margaret
gave a scream of horror. Almost instantly Brandon
brought the car to a stop and leaped to the
ground. Close by one of the big-rimmed wheels
lay a huddled little heap of soiled and ragged
pink calico; but before Brandon could reach it,
the heap stirred, and lifted itself. From beneath
a tangled thatch of brown curls looked out two
big brown eyes.
</p>
<p>
“I reckon mebbe I felled down,” said a cheery
voice that yet sounded a little dazed. “I reckon
I did.”
</p>
<p>
“Good heavens, baby, I reckon you did!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
breathed the man in glad relief. “And you may
thank your lucky stars ’twas no worse.”
</p>
<p>
“T’ank lucky stars. What are lucky stars?”
demanded the small girl, interestedly.
</p>
<p>
“Eh? Oh, lucky stars—why, they’re—what are
lucky stars, Miss Kendall?”
</p>
<p>
Margaret did not answer. She did not seem to
hear. With eyes that carried a fascinated terror
in their blue depths, she was looking at the dirty
little feet and the ragged dress of the child before
her.
</p>
<p>
“T’ank lucky stars,” murmured the little girl
again, putting out a cautious finger and just touching
the fat rubber tire of the wheel that had almost
crushed out her life.
</p>
<p>
Brandon shuddered involuntarily and drew the
child away.
</p>
<p>
“What’s your name, little girl?” he asked
gently.
</p>
<p>
“Maggie.”
</p>
<p>
“How old are you?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m ‘most five goin’ on six an’ I’ll be twelve
ter-morrer.”
</p>
<p>
Brandon smiled.
</p>
<p>
“And where do you live?” he continued.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
A thin little claw of a finger pointed to an unpainted,
shabby-looking cottage across the street.
At that moment a shrill voice called: “Maggie,
Maggie, what ye doin’? Come here, child.” And
a tall, gaunt woman appeared in the doorway.
</p>
<p>
Maggie turned slowly; but scarcely had the little
bare feet taken one step when the girl in the
automobile stirred as if waking from sleep.
</p>
<p>
“Here—quick—little girl, take this,” she cried,
tearing open the little jeweled purse at her belt,
and thrusting all its contents into the small, grimy
hands.
</p>
<p>
Maggie stared in wonder. Then her whole face
lighted up.
</p>
<p>
“Lucky stars!” she cried gleefully, her eyes on
the shining coins. “T’ank lucky stars!” And
she turned and ran with all her small might toward
the house.
</p>
<p>
“Quick—come—let us go,” begged Margaret,
“before the mother sees—the money!” And
Brandon, smiling indulgently at the generosity
that was so fearful of receiving thanks, lost no time
in putting a long stretch of roadway between
themselves and the tall, gaunt woman behind
them.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>
“Stars—t’ank lucky stars,” Maggie was
still shouting gleefully when she reached
her mother’s side.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Durgin bent keen eyes on her young
daughter’s face.
</p>
<p>
“Maggie, what was they sayin’ to ye?” she began,
pulling the little girl into the house. Suddenly
her jaw dropped. She stooped and clutched
the child’s hands. “Why, Maggie, it’s money—stacks
of it!” she exclaimed, prying open the
small fingers.
</p>
<p>
“Stars—lucky stars!” cooed Maggie. Maggie
liked new words and phrases, and she always said
them over and over until they were new no longer.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Durgin shook her daughter gently, yet determinedly.
Her small black eyes looked almost
large, so wide were they with amazement.
</p>
<p>
“Maggie, Maggie, tell me—what did they say
to ye?” she demanded again. “Why did they
give ye all this money?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
</p>
<p>
Maggie was silent. Her brow was drawn into
a thoughtful frown.
</p>
<p>
“But, Maggie, think—there must ‘a’ been somethin’.
What did ye do?”
</p>
<p>
“There wa’n’t,” insisted the child. “I jest felled
down an’ got up, an’ they said it.”
</p>
<p>
“Said what?”
</p>
<p>
“‘T’ank lucky stars.’”
</p>
<p>
A sudden thought sent a quick flash of fear to
Mrs. Durgin’s eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Maggie, they didn’t hurt ye,” she cried, dropping
on her knees and running swift, anxious
fingers over the thin little arms and legs and body.
“They didn’t hurt ye!”
</p>
<p>
Maggie shook her head. At that moment a
shadow darkened the doorway, and the kneeling
woman glanced up hastily.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it’s you, Mis’ Magoon,” she said to the
small, tired-looking woman in the doorway.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it’s me,” sighed the woman, dragging
herself across the room to a chair. “What time
did Nellie leave here?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, I dunno—mebbe four o’clock. Why?”
</p>
<p>
The woman’s face contracted with a sharp spasm
of pain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
</p>
<p>
“She wa’n’t within half a mile of the mill when
I met her, yet she was pantin’ an’ all out o’ breath
then. She’ll be late, ‘course, an’ you know what
that means.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I know,” sighed Mrs. Durgin, sympathetically.
“She—she hadn’t orter gone.”
</p>
<p>
Across the room Mrs. Magoon’s head came up
with a jerk.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t ye s’pose I know that? The child’s
sick, an’ I know it. But what diff’rence does that
make? She works, don’t she?”
</p>
<p>
For a moment Mrs. Durgin did not speak.
Gradually her eyes drifted back to Maggie and the
little pile of coins on the table.
</p>
<p>
“Mis’ Magoon, see,” she cried eagerly, “what the
lady give Maggie. They was in one o’ them ‘nauty-mobiles,’
as Maggie calls ’em, an’ Maggie felled
down in the road. She wa’n’t hurt a mite—not
even scratched, but they give her all this money.”
</p>
<p>
The woman on the other side of the room
sniffed disdainfully.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what of it? They’d oughter give it to
her,” she asserted.
</p>
<p>
“But they wa’n’t ter blame, an’ they didn’t hurt
her none—not a mite,” argued the other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
</p>
<p>
“No thanks ter them, I’ll warrant,” snapped
Mrs. Magoon. “For my part, I wouldn’t tech
their old money.” Then, crossly, but with undeniable
interest, she asked: “How much was it?”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Durgin laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Never you mind,” she retorted, as she gathered
up the coins from the table; “but thar’s
enough so’s I’m goin’ ter get them cough-drops
fur Nellie, anyhow. So!” And she turned her
back and pretended not to hear the faint remonstrances
from the woman over by the window.
Later, when she had bought the medicine and
had placed it in Mrs. Magoon’s hands, the remonstrances
were repeated in a higher key, and were
accompanied again with an angry snarl against
the world in general and automobiles in particular.
</p>
<p>
“But why do ye hate ’em so?” demanded Mrs.
Durgin, “—them autymobiles? They hain’t one
of ’em teched ye, as I knows of.”
</p>
<p>
There was no answer.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe ye knows yerself,” declared
the questioner then; and at the taunt the other
raised her head.
</p>
<p>
“Mebbe I don’t,” she flamed, “an’ ’tain’t them
I hate, anyway—it’s the folks in ’em. It’s rich
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
folks. I’ve allers hated ’em anywheres, but ‘twa’n’t
never so bad as now since them things came.
They look so—so comfortable—the folks a-leanin’
back on their cushions; an’ so—so <em>free</em>, as if there
wa’n’t nothin’ that could bother ’em. ‘Course I
knew before that there was rich folks, an’ that
they had fine clo’s an’ good things ter eat, an’
shows an’ parties, an’ spent money; but I didn’t
<em>see</em> ’em, an’ now I do. I <em>see</em> ’em, I tell ye, an’ it
makes me realize how I ain’t comfortable like
they be, nor Nellie ain’t neither!”
</p>
<p>
“But they ain’t all bad—rich folks,” argued the
thin, black-eyed woman, earnestly. “Some of ’em
is good.”
</p>
<p>
The other shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“I hain’t had the pleasure o’ meetin’ that kind,”
she rejoined grimly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I have,” retorted Maggie’s mother with
some spirit. “Look at that lady ter-night what
give Maggie all that money.”
</p>
<p>
There was no answer, and after a moment Mrs.
Durgin went on. Her voice was lower now, and
not quite clear.
</p>
<p>
“Thar was another one, too, an’ she was jest
like a angel out o’ heaven. It was years ago—much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
as twelve or fourteen, when I lived in New
York. She was the mother of the nicest an’ prettiest
little girl I ever see—the one I named my
Maggie for. An’ she asked us ter her home an’
we stayed weeks, an’ rode in her carriages, an’ ate
ter her table, an’ lived right with her jest as she
did. An’ when we come back ter New York she
come with us an’ took us out of the cellar an’
found a beautiful place fur us, all sun an’ winders,
an’ she paid up the rent fur us ‘way ahead whole
months. An’ thar was all the Whalens an’ me an’
the twins.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” prompted Mrs. Magoon, as the speaker
paused. “What next? You ain’t in New York,
an’ she ain’t a-doin’ it now, is she? Where is
she?”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Durgin turned her head away.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” she said.
</p>
<p>
The other sniffed.
</p>
<p>
“I thought as much. It don’t last—it never
does.”
</p>
<p>
“But it would ‘a’ lasted with her,” cut in Mrs.
Durgin, sharply. “She wa’n’t the kind what
gives up. She’s sick or dead, or somethin’—I
know she is. But thar’s others what has lasted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
That Mont-Lawn I was tellin’ ye of, whar I learned
them songs we sings, an’ whar I learned ‘most
ev’rythin’ good thar is in me—<em>that’s</em> done by rich
folks, an’ that’s lasted! They pays three dollars
an’ it lets some poor little boy or girl go thar an’
stay ten whole days jest eatin’ an’ sleepin’ an’
playin’. An’ if I was in New York now my
Maggie herself’d be a-goin’ one o’ these days—you’d
see! I tell ye, rich folks ain’t bad—all of
’em, an’ they do do things ’sides loll back in them
autymobiles!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Magoon stared, then she shrugged her
shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“Mebbe,” she admitted grudgingly. “Say—er—Mis’
Durgin, how much was that money
Maggie got—eh?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>
Margaret Kendall did not sleep
well the night after the picnic at Silver
Lake. She was restless, and she tossed
from side to side finding nowhere a position that
brought ease of mind and body. She closed her
eyes and tried to sleep, but her active brain painted
the dark with a panorama of the day’s happenings,
and whether her eyes were open or closed,
she was forced to see it. There were the lake, the
mountain, and the dainty luncheon spread on the
grass; and there were the faces of the merry
friends who had accompanied her. There were
the shifting scenes of the homeward ride, too, with
the towers of Hilcrest showing dark and clear-cut
against a blood-red sky. But everywhere, from
the lake, the mountain, and even from Hilcrest
itself, looked out strange wan faces with hollow
cheeks and mournful eyes; and everywhere fluttered
the ragged skirts of a child’s pink calico
dress.
</p>
<p>
It was two o’clock when Margaret arose, thrust
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
her feet into a pair of bed-slippers and her arms
into the sleeves of a long, loose dressing-gown.
There was no moon, but a starlit sky could be
seen through the open windows, and Margaret
easily found her way across the room to the door
that led to the balcony.
</p>
<p>
Margaret’s room, like the dining-room below,
looked toward the west and the far-reaching
meadows; but from the turn of the balcony where
it curved to the left, one might see the town, and
it was toward this curve that Margaret walked
now. Once there she stopped and stood motionless,
her slender hands on the balcony rail.
</p>
<p>
The night was wonderfully clear. The wide
dome of the sky twinkled with a myriad of stars,
and seemed to laugh at the town below with its
puny little lights blinking up out of the dark where
the streets crossed and recrossed. Over by the
river where the mills pointed big black fingers at
the sky, however, the lights did not blink. They
blazed in tier upon tier and line upon line of
windows, and they glowed with a never-ending
glare that sent a shudder to the watching girl on
the balcony.
</p>
<p>
“And they’re working now—<em>now</em>!” she almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
sobbed; then she turned with a little cry and ran
down the balcony toward her room where was
waiting the cool soft bed with the lavender-scented
sheets.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the restless night she had spent,
Margaret arose early the next morning. The
house was very quiet when she came down-stairs,
and only the subdued rustle of the
parlor maid’s skirts broke the silence of the
great hall which was also the living-room at
Hilcrest.
</p>
<p>
“Good-morning, Betty.”
</p>
<p>
“Good-morning, Miss,” courtesied the girl.
</p>
<p>
Miss Kendall had almost reached the outer hall
door when she turned abruptly.
</p>
<p>
“Betty, you—you don’t know a little child
named—er—‘Maggie’; do you?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Ma’am?” Betty almost dropped the vase she
was dusting.
</p>
<p>
“‘Maggie,’—a little girl named ‘Maggie.’ She’s
one of the—the mill people’s children, I think.”
</p>
<p>
Betty drew herself erect.
</p>
<p>
“No, Miss, I don’t,” she said crisply.
</p>
<p>
“No, of course not,” murmured Miss Kendall,
unconsciously acknowledging the reproach in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
Betty’s voice. Then she turned and went out the
wide hall door.
</p>
<p>
Twice she walked from end to end of the long
veranda, but not once did she look toward the
mills; and when she sat down a little later, her
chair was so placed that it did not command a
view of the red and brown roofs of the town.
</p>
<p>
Miss Kendall was restless that day. She rode
and drove and sang and played, and won at golf
and tennis; but behind it all was a feverish gayety
that came sometimes perilously near to recklessness.
Frank Spencer and his sister watched her
with troubled eyes, and even Ned gave an anxious
frown once or twice. Just before dinner
Brandon came upon her alone in the music room
where she was racing her fingers through the runs
and trills of an impromptu at an almost impossible
speed.
</p>
<p>
“If you take me motoring with you to-night,
Miss Kendall,” he said whimsically, when the
music had ceased with a crashing chord, “if you
take me to-night, I shall make sure that the brakes
<em>are</em> on my side of the car!”
</p>
<p>
The girl laughed, then grew suddenly grave.
</p>
<p>
“You would need to,” she acceded; “but—I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
shall not take you or any one else motoring to-night.”
</p>
<p>
In the early evening after dinner Margaret
sought her guardian. He was at his desk in his
own special den out of the library, and the door
was open.
</p>
<p>
“May I come in?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
Spencer sprang to his feet.
</p>
<p>
“By all means,” he cried as he placed a chair.
“You don’t often honor me—like this.”
</p>
<p>
“But this is where you do business, when at
home; isn’t it?” she inquired. “And I—I have
come to do business.”
</p>
<p>
The man laughed.
</p>
<p>
“So it’s business—just plain sordid business—to
which I am indebted for this,” he bemoaned
playfully. “Well, and what is it? Income too
small for expenses?” He chuckled a little, and
he could afford to. Margaret had made no mistake
in asking him still to have the handling of
her property. The results had been eminently
satisfactory both to his pride and her pocketbook.
</p>
<p>
“No, no, it’s not that; it’s the mills.”
</p>
<p>
“The mills!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Is it quite—quite necessary to work—nights?”
</p>
<p>
For a moment the man stared wordlessly; then
he fell back in his chair.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Margaret, what in the world——” he
stopped from sheer inability to proceed. He had
suddenly remembered the stories he had heard of
the early life of this girl before him, and of her
childhood’s horror at the difference between the
lot of the rich and the poor.
</p>
<p>
“Last night we—we came through the town,”
explained Margaret, a little feverishly; “and Mr.
Brandon happened to mention that they worked—nights.”
</p>
<p>
The man at the desk roused himself.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I see,” he said kindly. “You were surprised,
of course. But don’t worry, my child, or
let it fret you a moment. It’s nothing new.
They are used to it. They have done it for
years.”
</p>
<p>
“But at night—all night—it doesn’t seem
right. And it must be so—hard. <em>Must</em> they
do it?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, of course. Other mills run nights;
why shouldn’t ours? They expect it, Margaret.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
Besides, they are paid for it. Come, come,
dear girl, just look at it sensibly. Why, it’s the
night work that helps to swell your dividends.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret winced.
</p>
<p>
“I—I think I’d prefer them smaller,” she faltered.
She hesitated, then spoke again. “There’s
another thing, too, I wanted to ask you about.
There was a little girl, Maggie. She lives in one
of those shabby, unpainted houses at the foot of
the hill. I want to do something for her. Will
you see that this reaches her mother, please?”
And she held out a fat roll of closely folded bills.
“Now don’t—please don’t!” she cried, as she
saw the man’s remonstrative gesture. “Please
don’t say you can’t, and that indiscriminate giving
encourages pauperism. I used to hear that
so often at school whenever I wanted to give
something, and I—I hated it. If you could have
seen that poor little girl yesterday!—you will see
that she gets it; won’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“But, Margaret,” began the man helplessly, “I
don’t know the child—there are so many——” he
stopped, and Margaret picked up the dropped
thread.
</p>
<p>
“But you can find out,” she urged. “You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
must find out. Her name’s Maggie. You can
inquire—some one will know.”
</p>
<p>
“But, don’t you see——” the man’s face cleared
suddenly. “I’ll give it to Della,” he broke off in
quick relief. “She runs the charity part, and
she’ll know just what to do with it. Meanwhile,
let me thank you——”
</p>
<p>
“No, no,” interrupted Margaret, rising to go.
“It is you I have to thank for doing it for me,”
she finished as she hurried from the room.
</p>
<p>
“By George!” muttered the man, as he looked
at the denominations of the bills in his fingers.
“I’m not so sure but we may have our hands full,
after all—certainly, if she keeps on as she’s
begun!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>
It was after eight o’clock. The morning, for
so early in September, was raw and cold. A
tall young fellow, with alert gray eyes and a
square chin hurried around the corner of one of
the great mills, and almost knocked down a small
girl who was coming toward him with head bent
to the wind.
</p>
<p>
“Heigh-ho!” he cried, then stopped short.
The child had fallen back and was leaning against
the side of the building in a paroxysm of coughing.
She was thin and pale, and looked as if she
might be eleven years old. “Well, well!” he
exclaimed as soon as the child caught her breath.
“I reckon there’s room for both of us in the
world, after all.” Then, kindly: “Where were
you going?”
</p>
<p>
“Home, sir.”
</p>
<p>
He threw a keen look into her face.
</p>
<p>
“Are you one of the mill girls?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
</p>
<p>
“Night shift?”
</p>
<p>
She nodded.
</p>
<p>
“But it’s late—it’s after eight o’clock. Why
didn’t you go home with the rest?”
</p>
<p>
The child hesitated. Her eyes swerved from
his gaze. She looked as if she wanted to run
away.
</p>
<p>
“Come, come,” he urged kindly. “Answer
me. I won’t hurt you. I may help you. Let
us go around here where the wind doesn’t blow
so.” And he led the way to the sheltered side of
the building. “Now tell us all about it. Why
didn’t you go home with the rest?”
</p>
<p>
“I did start to, sir, but I was so tired, an’—an’
I coughed so, I stopped to rest. It was nice an’
cool out here, an’ I was so hot in there.” She
jerked her thumb toward the mill.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes, I know,” he said hastily; and his lips
set into stern lines as he thought of the hundreds
of other little girls that found the raw morning
“nice and cool” after the hot, moist air of the
mills.
</p>
<p>
“But don’t you see,” he protested earnestly,
“that that’s the very time you mustn’t stop and
rest? You take cold, and that’s what makes you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
cough. You shouldn’t be——” he stopped abruptly.
“What’s your name?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Nellie Magoon.”
</p>
<p>
“How old are you?”
</p>
<p>
The thin little face before him grew suddenly
drawn and old, and the eyes met his with a look
that was half-shrewd, half-terrified, and wholly
defiant.
</p>
<p>
“I’m thirteen, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“How old were you when you began to work here?”
</p>
<p>
“Twelve, sir.” The answer was prompt and
sure. The child had evidently been well trained.
</p>
<p>
“Where do you live?”
</p>
<p>
“Over on the Prospect Hill road.”
</p>
<p>
“But that’s a long way from here.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir. I does get tired.”
</p>
<p>
“And you’ve walked it a good many times,
too; haven’t you?” said the man, quietly. “Let’s
see, how long is it that you’ve worked at the
mills?”
</p>
<p>
“Two years, sir.”
</p>
<p>
A single word came sharply from between the
man’s close-shut teeth, and Nellie wondered why
the kind young man with the pleasant eyes should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
suddenly look so very cross and stern. At that
moment, too, she remembered something—she had
seen this man many times about the mills. Why
was he questioning her? Perhaps he was not
going to let her work any more, and if he did not
let her work, what would her mother say and
do?
</p>
<p>
“Please, sir, I must go, quick,” she cried suddenly,
starting forward. “I’m all well now, an’ I
ain’t tired a mite. I’ll be back ter-night. Jest remember
I’m thirteen, an’ I likes ter work in the
mills—I likes ter, sir,” she shouted back at him.
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” muttered the man, as he watched
the frail little figure disappear down the street.
“I thought as much!” Then he turned and
strode into the mill. “Oh, Mr. Spencer, I’d like
to speak to you, please, sir,” he called, hurrying
forward, as he caught sight of the younger member
of the firm of Spencer &amp; Spencer.
</p>
<p>
Fifteen minutes later Ned Spencer entered his
brother’s office, and dropped into the nearest
chair.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” he began wearily, “McGinnis is on the
war-path again.”
</p>
<p>
Frank smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
</p>
<p>
“So? What’s up now?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, same old thing—children working under
age. By his own story the girl herself swears
she’s thirteen, but he says she isn’t.”
</p>
<p>
Frank shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he knows better than the girl’s parents,”
he observed dryly. “He’d better look her
up on our registers, or he might ask to see her certificate.”
</p>
<p>
Ned laughed. He made an impatient gesture.
</p>
<p>
“Good heavens, Frank,” he snapped; “as if
’twas our fault that they lie so about the kids’
ages! They’d put a babe in arms at the frames
if they could. But McGinnis—by the way, where
did you get that fellow? and how long have you
had him? I can’t remember when he wasn’t here.
He acts as if he owned the whole concern, and
had a personal interest in every bobbin in it.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s exactly it,” laughed Frank. “He <em>has</em>
a personal interest, and that’s why I keep him,
and put up with some of his meddling that’s not
quite so pleasant. He’s as honest as the daylight,
and as faithful as the sun.”
</p>
<p>
“Where did you get him? He must have been
here ages.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ages? Well, for twelve—maybe thirteen
years, to be exact. He was a mere boy, fourteen
or fifteen, when he came. He said he was from
Houghtonsville, and that he had known Dr. Harry
Spencer. He asked for work—any kind, and
brought good references. We used him about the
office for awhile, then gradually worked him into
the mills. He was bright and capable, and untiring
in his efforts to please, so we pushed him
ahead rapidly. He went to night school at once,
and has taken one or two of those correspondence
courses until he’s acquired really a good education.
</p>
<p>
“He’s practically indispensable to me now—anyhow,
I found out that he was when he was laid
up for a month last winter. He stands between
me and the hands like a strong tower, and takes
any amount of responsibility off my shoulders.
You’ll see for yourself when you’ve been here
longer. The hands like him, and will do anything
for him. That’s why I put up with some of his
notions. They’re getting pretty frequent of late,
however, and he’s becoming a little too meddlesome.
I may have to call him down a peg.”
</p>
<p>
“You’d think so, I fancy, if you had heard him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
run on about this mill-girl half an hour ago,”
laughed Ned. “He said he should speak to
you.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good. Then I can speak to him,” retorted
the other, grimly.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p>
Early in the second week of September the
houseful of guests at Hilcrest went away,
leaving the family once more alone.
</p>
<p>
“It seems good; doesn’t it—just by ourselves,”
said Margaret that first morning at breakfast. As
she spoke three pairs of eyes flashed a message of
exultant thankfulness to each other, and three
heads nodded an “I told you so!” when Margaret’s
gaze was turned away. Later, Mrs. Merideth
put the sentiment into words, as she followed her
brothers to the door.
</p>
<p>
“You see, I was right,” she declared. “Margaret
only needed livening up. She’s all right
now, and will be contented here with us.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure!” agreed Ned, as he stepped out on to
the veranda. Frank paused a moment.
</p>
<p>
“Has she ever been to you again, Della, with
money, or—or anything?” he asked in a low
voice.
</p>
<p>
“No, never,” replied Mrs. Merideth. “She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
asked once if I’d found the child, Maggie, to give
the money to, and I evaded a direct reply. I told
her I had put the money into the hands of the
Guild, and that they were in constant touch with
all cases of need. I got her interested in talking
of something else, and she did not say anything
more about it.”
</p>
<p>
“Good! It’s the best way. You know her history,
and how morbid she got when she was a
child. It won’t do to run any chances of that happening
again; and I fear ‘twouldn’t take much to
bring it back. She was not a little excited when
she brought the money in to me that night. We
must watch out sharp,” he finished as he passed
through the door, and hurried down the steps after
his brother.
</p>
<p>
Back in the dining-room Margaret had wandered
listlessly to the window. It had been some
weeks since she had seen a long day before her
with no plans to check off the time into hours and
half-hours of expected happenings. She told herself
that it was a relief and that she liked it—but
her fingers tapped idly upon the window, and her
eyes gazed absent-mindedly at a cloud sailing
across a deep blue sky.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
</p>
<p>
After a time she turned to the door near by and
stepped out upon the veranda. She could hear
voices from around the corner, and aimlessly she
wandered toward them. But before she had
reached the turn the voices had ceased; and a
minute later she saw Frank and Ned step into the
waiting automobile and whir rapidly down the
driveway.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Merideth had disappeared into the house,
and Margaret found herself alone. Slowly she
walked toward the railing and looked at the town
far below. The roofs showed red and brown and
gray in the sunlight, and were packed close together
save at the outer edges, where they thinned
into a straggling fringe of small cottages and
dilapidated shanties.
</p>
<p>
Margaret shivered with repulsion. How dreadful
it must be to live like that—no air, no sun, no
view of the sky and of the cool green valley!
And there were so many of them—those poor
creatures down there, with their wasted forms and
sunken eyes! She shuddered again as she thought
of how they had thronged the road on the day of
the picnic at Silver Lake—and then she turned
and walked with resolute steps to the farther side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
of the veranda where only the valley and the hills
met her eyes.
</p>
<p>
It had been like this with Margaret every day
since that memorable ride home with Mr. Brandon.
Always her steps, her eyes, and her thoughts
had turned toward the town; and always, with
uncompromising determination, they had been
turned about again by sheer force of will until
they looked toward the valley with its impersonal
green and silver. Until now there had been gay
companions and absorbing pastimes to make this
turning easy and effectual; now there was only
the long unbroken day of idleness in prospect, and
the turning was neither so easy nor so effectual.
The huddled roofs and dilapidated shanties of the
town looked up at her even from the green of
the valley; and the wasted forms and hollow eyes
of the mill workers blurred the sheen of the river.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go down there,” she cried aloud with
sudden impulsiveness. “I’ll go back through the
way we came up; then perhaps I’ll be cured.”
And she hurried away to order the runabout to be
brought to the door for her use.
</p>
<p>
To Margaret it was all very clear. She needed
but a sane, daylight ride through those streets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
down there to drive away forever the morbid
fancies that had haunted her so long. She told
herself that it was the hour, the atmosphere, the
half-light, that had painted the picture of horror
for her. Under the clear light of the sun those
swarming multitudes would be merely men,
women, and children, not haunting ghosts of
misery. There was the child, Maggie, too. Perhaps
she might be found, and it would be delightful,
indeed, to see for herself the comforting results
of the spending of that roll of money she had
put into her guardian’s hands some time before.
</p>
<p>
Of all this Margaret thought, and it was therefore
with not unpleasant anticipations that she
stepped into the runabout a little later, and waved
a good-bye to Mrs. Merideth, with a cheery: “I’m
off for a little spin, Aunt Della. I’ll be back
before luncheon.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret was very sure that she knew the way,
and some distance below the house she made the
turn that would lead to what was known as the
town road. The air was fresh and sweet, and
the sun flickered through the trees in dancing
little flecks of light that set the girl’s pulses to
throbbing in sympathy, and caused her to send
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
the car bounding forward as if it, too, had red
blood in its veins. Far down the hill the woods
thinned rapidly, and a house or two appeared.
Margaret went more slowly now. Somewhere
was the home of little Maggie, and she did not
want to miss it.
</p>
<p>
Houses and more houses appeared, and the
trees were left behind. There was now only the
glaring sunlight showing up in all their barrenness
the shabby little cottages with their dooryards
strewn with tin cans and bits of paper, and
swarming with half-clothed, crying babies.
</p>
<p>
From somewhere came running a saucy-faced,
barefooted urchin, then another and another, until
the road seemed lined with them.
</p>
<p>
“Hi, thar, look at de buz-wagon wid de gal in
it!” shrieked a gleeful voice, and instantly the
cry was taken up and echoed from across the
street with shrill catcalls and derisive laughter.
</p>
<p>
Margaret was frightened. She tooted her horn
furiously, and tried to forge ahead; but the children,
reading aright the terror in her eyes, swarmed
about her until she was forced to bring the car
almost to a stop lest she run over the small squirming
bodies.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
</p>
<p>
With shrieks of delight the children instantly
saw their advantage, and lost no time in making
the most of it. They leaped upon the low step
and clung to the sides and front of the car like
leeches. Two larger boys climbed to the back
and hung there with swinging feet, their jeering
lips close to Miss Kendall’s shrinking ears. A
third boy, still more venturesome, had almost
reached the vacant seat at Miss Kendall’s side,
when above the din of hoots and laughter, sounded
an angry voice and a sharp command.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p>
It had been young McGinnis’s intention to
look up the home and the parents of the
little mill-girl, Nellie Magoon, at once, and
see if something could not be done to keep—for a
time, at least—that frail bit of humanity out of the
mills. Some days had elapsed, however, since he
had talked with the child, and not until now had
he found the time to carry out his plan. He was
hurrying with frowning brow along the lower end
of Prospect Hill road when suddenly his ears were
assailed by the unmistakable evidence that somewhere
a mob of small boys had found an object
upon which to vent their wildest mischief. The
next moment a turn of the road revealed the
almost motionless runabout with its living freight
of shrieking urchins, and its one white-faced, terrified
girl.
</p>
<p>
With a low-breathed “Margaret!” McGinnis
sprang forward.
</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>
It was all done so quickly that even the girl
herself could not have told how it happened.
Almost unconsciously she slipped over into the
vacant seat and gave her place to the fearless,
square-jawed man who seemingly had risen from
the ground. An apparently impossible number
of long arms shot out to the right and to the left,
and the squirming urchins dropped to the ground,
sprawling on all fours, and howling with surprise
and chagrin. Then came a warning cry and a
sharp “honk-honk-honk” from the horn. The
next moment the car bounded forward on a roadway
that opened clear and straight before it.
</p>
<p>
Not until he had left the town quite behind him
did McGinnis bring the car to a halt in the shade
of a great tree by the roadside. Then he turned
an anxious face to the girl at his side.
</p>
<p>
“You’re not hurt, I hope, Miss Kendall,” he
began. “I didn’t like to stop before to ask. I
hope you didn’t mind being thrust so unceremoniously
out of your place and run away with,” he
finished, a faint twinkle coming into his gray eyes.
</p>
<p>
Margaret flushed. Before she spoke she put
both hands to her head and straightened her hat.
</p>
<p>
“No, I—I’m not hurt,” she said faintly; “but I
<em>was</em> frightened. You—you were very good to
run away with me,” she added, the red deepening in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
her cheeks. “I’m sure I don’t know what
I should have done if you hadn’t.”
</p>
<p>
The man’s face darkened.
</p>
<p>
“The little rascals!” he cried. “They deserve
a sound thrashing—every one of them.”
</p>
<p>
“But I’d done nothing—I’d not spoken to
them,” she protested. “I don’t see why they
should have molested me.”
</p>
<p>
“Pure mischief, to begin with, probably,” returned
the man; “then they saw that you were
frightened, and that set them wild with delight.
All is—I’m glad I was there,” he concluded, with
grim finality.
</p>
<p>
Margaret turned quickly.
</p>
<p>
“And so am I,” she said, “and yet I don’t even
know whom to thank, though you evidently know
me. You seemed to come from the ground, and
you handled the car as if it were your own.”
</p>
<p>
With a sudden exclamation the man stepped to
the ground; then he turned and faced her, hat in
hand.
</p>
<p>
“And I’m acting now as if it were my own,
too,” he said, almost bitterly. “I beg your pardon,
Miss Kendall. I have run it many times for
Mr. Spencer; that explains my familiarity with it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
</p>
<p>
“And you are——” she paused expectantly.
</p>
<p>
The man hesitated. It was almost on his
tongue’s end to say, “One of the mill-hands”;
then something in the bright face, the pleasant
smile, the half-outstretched hand, sent a strange
light to his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“I am—Miss Kendall, I have half a mind to tell
you who I am.”
</p>
<p>
She threw a quick look into his face and drew
back a little; but she said graciously:
</p>
<p>
“Of course you will tell me who you are.”
</p>
<p>
There was a moment’s silence, then slowly he
asked:
</p>
<p>
“Do you remember—Bobby McGinnis?”
</p>
<p>
“Bobby? Bobby McGinnis?” The blue eyes
half closed and seemed to be looking far into the
past. Suddenly they opened wide and flashed a
glad recognition into his face. “And are you
Bobby McGinnis?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, of course I remember Bobby McGinnis,”
she cried, with outstretched hand. “It was you
that found me when I was a wee bit of a girl and
lost in New York, though <em>that</em> I don’t remember.
But we used to play together there in Houghtonsville,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
and it was you that got me the contract——”
She stopped abruptly and turned her face away.
The man saw her lips and chin tremble. “I can’t
speak of it—even now,” she said brokenly, after a
moment. Then, gently: “Tell me of yourself.
How came you here?”
</p>
<p>
“I came here at once from Houghtonsville.”
McGinnis’s voice, too, was not quite steady. She
nodded, and he went on without explaining the
“at once”—he had thought she would understand.
“I went to work in the mills, and—I have
been here ever since. That is all,” he said simply.
</p>
<p>
“But how happened it that you came—here?”
</p>
<p>
A dull red flushed the man’s cheeks. His eyes
swerved from her level gaze, then came back suddenly
with the old boyish twinkle in their depths.
</p>
<p>
“I came,” he began slowly, “well, to look after
your affairs.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>My</em> affairs!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I was fifteen. I deemed somehow that
I was the one remaining friend who had your best
interests at heart. I <em>couldn’t</em> look after you, naturally—in
a girls’ school—so I did the next best
thing. I looked after your inheritance.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear old Bobby!” murmured the girl. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
the man who heard knew, in spite of a conscious
throb of joy, that it was the fifteen-year-old lad
that Margaret Kendall saw before her, not the
man-grown standing at her side.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose I thought,” he resumed after a moment,
“that if I were not here some one might
pick up the mills and run off with them.”
</p>
<p>
“And now?” She was back in the present,
and her eyes were merry.
</p>
<p>
“And now? Well, now I come nearer realizing
my limitations, perhaps,” he laughed. “At any
rate, I learned long ago that your interests were
in excellent hands, and that my presence could do
very little good, even if they had not been in such
fine shape.... But I am keeping you,” he
broke off suddenly, backing away from the car.
“Are you—can you—you do not need me any
longer to run the machine? You’ll not go back
through the town, of course.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I shall not go back through the town,”
shuddered the girl. “And I can drive very well
by myself now, I am sure,” she declared. And he
did not know that for a moment she had been
tempted to give quite the opposite answer. “I
shall go on to the next turn, and then around home
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
by the other way.... But I shall see you
soon again?—you will come to see me?” she finished,
as she held out her hand.
</p>
<p>
McGinnis shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Kendall, in the kindness of her heart,
forgets,” he reminded her quietly. “Bobby McGinnis
is not on Hilcrest’s calling list.”
</p>
<p>
“But Bobby McGinnis is my friend,” retorted
Miss Kendall with a bright smile, “and Hilcrest
always welcomes my friends.”
</p>
<p>
Still standing under the shadow of the great
tree, McGinnis watched the runabout until a turn
of the road hid it from sight.
</p>
<p>
“I thought ‘twould be easier after I’d met her
once, face to face, and spoken to her,” he was
murmuring softly; “but it’s going to be harder,
I’m afraid—harder than when I just caught a
glimpse of her once in a while and knew that she
was here.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p>
Margaret’s morning ride through the
town did not have quite the effect she
had hoped it would. By daylight the
place looked even worse than by the softening
twilight. But she was haunted now, not so much
by the wan faces of the workers as by the jeering
countenances of a mob of mischievous boys. To
be sure, the unexpected meeting with Bobby McGinnis
had in a measure blurred the vision, but it
was still there; and at night she awoke sometimes
with those horrid shouts in her ears. Of one thing
it had cured her, however: she no longer wished
to see for herself the shabby cottages and the people
in them. She gave money, promptly and
liberally—so liberally, in fact, that Mrs. Merideth
quite caught her breath at the size of the bills that
the young woman stuffed into her hands.
</p>
<p>
“But, my dear, so much!” she had remonstrated.
</p>
<p>
“No, no—take it, do!” Margaret had pleaded.
“Give it to that society to do as they like with it.
And when it’s gone there’ll be more.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Merideth had taken the money then without
more ado. The one thing she wished particularly
to avoid in the matter was controversy—for
controversy meant interest.
</p>
<p>
There had been one other result of that morning’s
experience—a result which to Frank Spencer
was perhaps quite as startling as had been the roll
of bills to his sister.
</p>
<p>
“I met your Mr. Robert McGinnis when I was
out this morning,” Margaret had said that night
at dinner. “What sort of man is he?”
</p>
<p>
Before Frank could reply Ned had answered for
him.
</p>
<p>
“He’s a little tin god on wheels, Margaret, that
can do no wrong. That’s what he is.”
</p>
<p>
“Ned!” remonstrated Mrs. Merideth in a horror
that was not all playful. Then to Margaret: “He
is a very faithful fellow and an efficient workman,
my dear, who is a great help to Frank. But how
and where did <em>you</em> see him?”
</p>
<p>
Margaret laughed.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you,” she promised in response to Mrs.
Merideth’s question; “but I haven’t heard yet
from the head of the house.”
</p>
<p>
“I can add little to what has been said,” declared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
Frank with a smile. “He is all that they
pictured him. He is the king-pin, the keystone—anything
you please. But, why?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing, only I know him. He is an old
friend.”
</p>
<p>
“You know him!—a <em>friend</em>!” The three voices
were one in shocked amazement.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, long ago in Houghtonsville,” smiled Margaret.
“He knew me still longer ago than that,
but that part I remember only as it has been told
to me. He was the little boy who found me crying
in the streets of New York, and took me home
to his mother.”
</p>
<p>
There was a stunned silence around the table.
It was the first time the Spencers had ever heard
Margaret speak voluntarily of her childhood, and
it frightened them. It seemed to bring into the
perfumed air of the dining-room the visible
presence of poverty and misery. They feared,
too, for Margaret: this was the one thing that
must be guarded against—the possible return to
the morbid fancies of her youth. And this man—
</p>
<p>
“Why, how strange!” murmured Mrs. Merideth,
breaking the pause. “But then, after all,
he’ll not annoy you, I fancy.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
</p>
<p>
“Of course not,” cut in Ned. “McGinnis is
no fool, and he knows his place.”
</p>
<p>
“Most assuredly,” declared Frank, with a sudden
tightening of his lips. “You’ll not see him
again, I fancy. If he annoys you, let me know.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but ‘twon’t be an annoyance,” smiled
Margaret. “I <em>asked</em> him to come and see me.”
</p>
<p>
“You—asked—him—to come!” To the
Spencers it was as if she had taken one of the
big black wheels from the mills and suggested
its desirability for the drawing-room. “You
asked him to come!”
</p>
<p>
Was there a slight lifting of the delicately
moulded chin opposite?—the least possible dilation
of the sensitive nostrils? Perhaps. Yet
Margaret’s voice when she answered, was clear
and sweet.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I told him that Hilcrest would always
welcome my friends, I was sure. And—wasn’t
I right?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course—certainly,” three almost inaudible
voices had murmured. And that had been the
end of it, except that the two brothers and the
sister had talked it over in low distressed voices
after Margaret had gone up-stairs to bed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
Two weeks had passed now, however, since
that memorable night, and the veranda of Hilcrest
had not yet echoed to the sound of young
McGinnis’s feet. The Spencers breathed a little
more freely in consequence. It might be possible,
after all, thought they, that <em>McGinnis</em> had
some sense!—and the emphasis was eloquent.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<p>
Miss Kendall was sitting alone before
the great fireplace in the hall at Hilcrest
when Betty, the parlor maid, found her.
Betty’s nose, always inclined to an upward tilt,
was even more disdainful than usual this morning.
In fact, Betty’s whole self from cap to dainty
shoes radiated strong disapproval.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a young person—a very impertinent
young person at the side door, Miss, who insists
upon seeing you,” she said severely.
</p>
<p>
“Me? Seeing me? Who is it, Betty?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, Miss. She looks like a mill
girl.” Even Betty’s voice seemed to shrink from
the “mill” as if it feared contamination.
</p>
<p>
“A mill girl? Then it must be Mrs. Merideth
or Mr. Spencer that she wants to see.”
</p>
<p>
“She said you, Miss. She said she wanted
to see——” Betty stopped, looking a little frightened.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, go on, Betty.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
</p>
<p>
“That—that she wanted to see Miss <em>Maggie</em>
Kendall,” blurted out the horrified Betty. “‘Mag
of the Alley.’”
</p>
<p>
Miss Kendall sprang to her feet.
</p>
<p>
“Bring the girl here, Betty,” she directed
quickly. “I will see her at once.”
</p>
<p>
Just what and whom she expected to see,
Margaret could not have told. For the first surprised
instant it seemed that some dimly remembered
Patty or Clarabella or Arabella from
the past must be waiting out there at the door;
the next moment she knew that this was impossible,
for time, even in the Alley, could not
have stood still, and Patty and the twins must be
women-grown now.
</p>
<p>
Out at the side door the “impertinent young
person” received Betty’s order to “come in” with
an airy toss of her head, and a jeering “There,
what’d I tell ye?” but once in the subdued luxury
of soft rugs and silken hangings, and face to face
with a beauteous vision in a trailing pale blue
gown, she became at once only a very much
frightened little girl about eleven years old.
</p>
<p>
At a sign from Miss Kendall, Betty withdrew
and left the two alone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p>
“What is your name, little girl?” asked Miss
Kendall gently.
</p>
<p>
The child swallowed and choked a little.
</p>
<p>
“Nellie Magoon, ma’am, if you please, thank
you,” she stammered.
</p>
<p>
“Where do you live?”
</p>
<p>
“Down on the Prospect Hill road.”
</p>
<p>
“Who sent you to me?”
</p>
<p>
“Mis’ Durgin.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Kendall frowned and paused a moment. As
yet there had not been a name that she recognized,
nor could she find in the child’s face the slightest
resemblance to any one she had ever seen before.
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t understand,” she protested.
“Who is this Mrs. Durgin? What did she tell
you to say to me?”
</p>
<p>
“She said, ‘Tell her Patty is in trouble an’
wants ter see Mag of the Alley,’” murmured the
child, as if reciting a lesson.
</p>
<p>
“‘Patty’? ‘Patty’? Not Patty Murphy!”
cried Miss Kendall, starting forward and grasping
the child’s arm.
</p>
<p>
Nellie drew back, half frightened.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am. No, ma’am. I don’t know,
ma’am,” she stammered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
“But how came she to send for me? Who told
her I was here?”
</p>
<p>
“The boss.”
</p>
<p>
“The—boss!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Mr. McGinnis, ye know. He said as
how you was here.”
</p>
<p>
“Bobby!” cried Miss Kendall, releasing the
child’s arm and falling back a step. “Why, of
course, it’s Patty—it must be Patty! I’ll go to
her at once. Wait here while I dress.” And she
hurried across the hall and up the broad stairway.
</p>
<p>
Back by the door Nellie watched the disappearing
blue draperies with wistful eyes that bore also
a trace of resentment. “Go and dress” indeed!
As if there could be anything more altogether to
be desired than that beautiful trailing blue gown!
She was even more dissatisfied ten minutes later
when Miss Kendall came back in the trim brown
suit and walking-hat—it would have been so much
more delightful to usher into Mrs. Durgin’s presence
that sumptuous robe of blue! She forgot
her disappointment, however, a little later, in
the excitement of rolling along at Miss Kendall’s
side in the Hilcrest carriage, with the imposing-looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
coachman in the Spencer livery towering
above her on the seat in front.
</p>
<p>
It had been Miss Kendall’s first thought to
order the runabout, but a sudden remembrance
of her morning’s experience a few weeks before
caused her to think that the stalwart John and the
horses might be better; so John, somewhat to his
consternation, it must be confessed, had been
summoned to take his orders from Nellie as to roads
and turns. He now sat, stern and dignified, in the
driver’s seat, showing by the very lines of his stiffly-held
body his entire disapproval of the whole affair.
</p>
<p>
Nor were John and Betty the only ones at Hilcrest
who were conscious of keen disapproval that
morning. The mistress herself, from an upper
window, watched with dismayed eyes the departure
of the carriage.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve found Patty, the little girl who was so
good to me in New York,” Margaret had explained
breathlessly, flying into the room three minutes
before. “She’s in trouble and has sent for me.
I’m taking John and the horses, so I’ll be all right.
Don’t worry!” And with that she was gone,
leaving behind her a woman too dazed to reply
by so much as a word.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
</p>
<p>
Hilcrest was not out of sight before Margaret
turned to the child at her side.
</p>
<p>
“You said she was in trouble—my friend, Patty.
What is it?” she questioned.
</p>
<p>
“It’s little Maggie. She’s sick.”
</p>
<p>
“Maggie? Not <em>the</em> Maggie, the little brown-eyed
girl in the pink calico dress, who fell down
almost in front of our auto!”
</p>
<p>
Nellie turned abruptly, her thin little face alight.
</p>
<p>
“Gee! Was that you? Did you give her the
money? Say, now, ain’t that queer!”
</p>
<p>
“Then it is Maggie, and she’s Patty’s little
girl,” cried Margaret. “And to think I was so
near and didn’t know! But tell me about her.
What is the matter?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<p>
Down in the shabby little cottage on the
Hill road Mrs. Durgin walked the floor,
vibrating between the window and the
low bed in the corner. By the stove sat Mrs.
Magoon, mending a pair of trousers—and talking.
To those who knew Mrs. Magoon, it was never
necessary to add that last—if Mrs. Magoon was
there, so also was the talking.
</p>
<p>
“It don’t do no good ter watch the pot—‘twon’t
b’ile no quicker,” she was saying now,
her eyes on the woman who was anxiously scanning
the road from the window.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I know,” murmured Mrs. Durgin, resolutely
turning her back on the window and going
over to the bed. Sixty seconds later, however,
she was again in her old position at the window,
craning her neck to look far up the road.
</p>
<p>
“How’s Maggie doin’ now?” asked Mrs. Magoon.
</p>
<p>
“She’s asleep.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, she better be awake,” retorted Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
Magoon, “so’s ter keep her ma out o’ mischief.
Come, come, Mis’ Durgin, why don’t ye settle
down an’ do somethin’? Jest call it she ain’t
a-comin’, then ’twill be all the more happyfyin’
surprise if she does.”
</p>
<p>
“But she is a-comin’.”
</p>
<p>
“How do ye know she is?”
</p>
<p>
“’Cause she’s Maggie Kendall, an’ she was
Mag of the Alley: an’ Mag of the Alley don’t go
back on her friends.”
</p>
<p>
“But she’s rich now.”
</p>
<p>
“I know she is, an’ you don’t think rich folks is
any good; but I do, an’ thar’s the diff’rence. Mr.
McGinnis has seen her, an’ he says she’s jest as
nice as ever.”
</p>
<p>
“Mebbe she is nice ter folks o’ her sort, but
even Mr. McGinnis don’t know that you’ve sent
fur her ter come ’way off down here.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it, but—Mis’ Magoon, she’s come!”
broke off Mrs. Durgin; and something in her face
and voice made the woman by the stove drop her
work and run to the window.
</p>
<p>
Drawn up before the broken-hinged, half-open
gate, were the Spencers’ famous span of
thoroughbreds, prancing, arching their handsome
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
necks, and apparently giving the mighty personage
on the driver’s seat all that he wanted to do
to hold them. Behind, in the luxurious carriage,
sat a ragged little girl, and what to Patty Durgin
was a wonderful vision in golden brown.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Durgin was thoroughly frightened. She,
<em>she</em> had summoned this glorious creature to come
to her, because, indeed, her little girl, Maggie,
was sick! And where, in the vision before her,
was there a trace of Mag of the Alley? Just what
she had expected to see, Mrs. Durgin did not
know—but certainly not this; and she fairly
shook in her shoes as the visible evidence of her
audacity, in the shape of the vision in golden
brown, walked up the little path from the gate.
</p>
<p>
It was Mrs. Magoon who had to go to the
door.
</p>
<p>
The young woman on the door-step started
eagerly forward, but fell back with a murmured,
“Oh, but you can’t be—Patty!”
</p>
<p>
Over by the window the tall, black-eyed woman
stirred then, as if by sheer force of will.
</p>
<p>
“No, no, it’s me that’s Patty,” she began
hurriedly. “An’ I hadn’t oughter sent fur ye;
but”—her words were silenced by a pair of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
brown-clad arms that were flung around her
neck.
</p>
<p>
“Patty—it is Patty!” cried an eager voice, and
Mrs. Durgin found herself looking into the well-remembered
blue eyes of the old-time Mag of
the Alley.
</p>
<p>
Later, when Mrs. Magoon had taken herself
and her amazed ejaculations, together with her
round-eyed daughter, home—which was, after all,
merely the other side of the shabby little house—Patty
and Margaret sat down to talk. In the bed
in the corner little Maggie still slept, and they
lowered their voices that they might not wake
her.
</p>
<p>
“Now, tell me everything,” commanded Margaret.
“I want to know everything that’s happened.”
</p>
<p>
Patty shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“Thar ain’t much, an’ what thar is ain’t interestin’,”
she said. “We jest lived, an’ we’re
livin’ now. Nothin’ much happens.”
</p>
<p>
“But you married.”
</p>
<p>
Patty flushed. Her eyes fell.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“And your husband—he’s—living?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret hesitated. This was plainly an unpleasant
subject, yet if she were to give any help
that <em>was</em> help—
</p>
<p>
Patty saw the hesitation, and divined its cause.
</p>
<p>
“You—you better leave Sam out,” she said
miserably. “He has ter be left out o’ most
things. Sam—drinks.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but we aren’t going to leave Sam out,”
retorted Margaret, brightly; and at the cheery
tone Patty raised her head.
</p>
<p>
“He didn’t used ter be left out, once—when I
married him eight years ago,” she declared.
“We worked in the mill—both of us, an’ done
well.”
</p>
<p>
“Here?”
</p>
<p>
Patty turned her eyes away. All the animation
fled from her face and left it gray and pinched.
</p>
<p>
“No. We hain’t been here but two years.
We jest kind of drifted here from the last place.
We don’t never stay long—in one place.”
</p>
<p>
“And the twins—where are they?”
</p>
<p>
A spasm of pain tightened Patty’s lips.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“You—don’t—know!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
“No. They lived with us at first, an’ worked
some in the mill. Arabella couldn’t much; you
know she was lame. After Sam got—worse, he
didn’t like ter have ’em ‘round, an’ ‘course they
found it out. One night he—struck Arabella, an’
’course that settled things. Clarabella wouldn’t
let her stay thar another minute, an’—an’ I
wouldn’t neither. Jest think—an’ her lame, an’
we always treatin’ her so gentle! I give ’em
what little money I had, an’ they left ‘fore
mornin’. I couldn’t go. My little Maggie wa’n’t
but three days old.”
</p>
<p>
“But you heard from them—you knew where
they went?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, once or twice. They started fur New
York, an’ got thar all right. We was down in
Jersey then, an’ ‘twa’n’t fur. They found the
Whalens an’ went back ter them. After that I
didn’t hear. You know the twins wa’n’t much
fur writin’, an’—well, we left whar we was, anyhow.
I’ve wrote twice, but thar hain’t nothin’
come of it.... But I hadn’t oughter run on
so,” she broke off suddenly. “You was so good
ter come. Mis’ Magoon said you—you wouldn’t
want to.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
</p>
<p>
“Want to? Of course I wanted to!”
</p>
<p>
“I know; but it had been so long, an’ we
hadn’t never heard from you since you got the
Whalens their new—that is——” she stopped, a
painful red dyeing her cheeks.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I know,” said Margaret, gently. “You
thought we had forgotten you, and no wonder.
But you know now? Bobby told you that——”
her voice broke, and she did not finish her sentence.
</p>
<p>
Patty nodded, her eyes averted. She could not
speak.
</p>
<p>
“Those years—afterward, were never very clear
to me,” went on Margaret, unsteadily. “It was
all so terrible—so lonely. I know I begged to go
back—to the Alley; and I talked of you and the
others constantly. But they kept everything
from me. They never spoke of those years in
New York, and they surrounded me with all sorts
of beautiful, interesting things, and did everything
in the world to make me happy. In time they
succeeded—in a way. But I think I never quite
forgot. There was always something—somewhere—behind
things; yet after a while it seemed
like a dream, or like a life that some one else had
lived.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p>
Margaret had almost forgotten Patty’s presence.
Her eyes were on the broken-hinged gate out the
window, and her voice was so low as to be almost
inaudible. It was a cry from little Maggie that
roused her, and together with Patty she sprang toward
the bed.
</p>
<p>
“My—lucky—stars!” murmured the child, a
little later, in dim recollection as she gazed into
the visitor’s face.
</p>
<p>
“You precious baby! And it shall be ‘lucky
stars’—you’ll see!” cried Margaret.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<p>
It was, indeed, “lucky stars,” as little Maggie
soon found out. Others found it out,
too; but to some of these it was not “lucky”
stars.
</p>
<p>
At the dinner table on that first night after the
visit to Patty’s house, Margaret threw the family
into no little consternation by abruptly asking:
</p>
<p>
“How do you go to work to get men and
things to put houses into livable shape?...
I don’t suppose I did word it in a very businesslike
manner,” she added laughingly, in response
to Frank Spencer’s amazed ejaculation.
</p>
<p>
“But what—perhaps I don’t quite understand,”
he murmured.
</p>
<p>
“No, of course you don’t,” replied Margaret;
“and no wonder. I’ll explain. You see I’ve
found another of my friends. It’s the little girl,
Patty, with whom I lived three years in New York.
She’s down in one of the mill cottages, and it
leaks and is in bad shape generally. I want to fix
it up.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
</p>
<p>
There was a dazed silence; then Frank Spencer
recovered his wits and his voice.
</p>
<p>
“By all means,” he rejoined hastily. “It shall
be attended to at once. Just give me your directions
and I will send the men around there right
away.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you; then I’ll meet them there and tell
them just what I want done.”
</p>
<p>
Frank Spencer moistened his lips, which had
grown unaccountably dry.
</p>
<p>
“But, my dear Margaret,” he remonstrated,
“surely it isn’t necessary that you yourself should
be subjected to such annoyance. I can attend to
all that is necessary.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but I don’t mind a bit,” returned Margaret,
brightly. “I <em>want</em> to do it. It’s for Patty, you
know.” And Frank Spencer could only fall back
in his chair with an uneasy glance at his sister.
</p>
<p>
Before the week was out there seemed to be a
good many things that were “for Patty, you
know.” There was the skilled physician summoned
to prescribe for Maggie; and there was
the strong, capable woman hired to care for her,
and to give the worn-out mother a much needed
rest. There were the large baskets of fruit and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
vegetables, and the boxes of beautiful flowers. In
fact there seemed to be almost nothing throughout
the whole week that was not “for Patty, you know.”
</p>
<p>
Even Margaret’s time—that, too, was given to
Patty. The golf links and the tennis court were
deserted. Neither Ned nor the beautiful October
weather could tempt Margaret to a single game.
The music room, too, was silent, and the piano
was closed.
</p>
<p>
Down in the little house on the Prospect Hill
road, however, a radiant young woman was
superintending the work that was fast putting the
cottage into a shape that was very much “livable.”
Meanwhile this same radiant young woman was
getting acquainted with her namesake.
</p>
<p>
“Lucky Stars,” as the child insisted upon calling
her, and Maggie were firm friends. Good
food and proper care were fast bringing the little
girl back to health; and there was nothing she so
loved to do as to “play” with the beautiful young
lady who had never yet failed to bring toy or game
or flower for her delight.
</p>
<p>
“And how old are you now?” Margaret would
laughingly ask each day, just to hear the prompt
response:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m ‘most five goin’ on six an’ I’ll be twelve
ter-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret always chuckled over this retort and
never tired of hearing it, until one day Patty
sharply interfered.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t—please don’t! I can’t bear it when
you don’t half know what it means.”
</p>
<p>
“When I don’t know what it means! Why,
Patty!” exclaimed Margaret.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. It’s Sam. He learned it to her.”
</p>
<p>
“Well?” Margaret’s eyes were still puzzled.
</p>
<p>
“He likes it. He <em>wants</em> her ter be twelve, ye
know,” explained Patty with an effort. Then, as
she saw her meaning was still not clear, she added
miserably:
</p>
<p>
“She can work then—in the mills.”
</p>
<p>
“In the mills—at twelve years old!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the age, ye know, when they can git
their papers—that is, if it’s summer—vacation
time: an’ they looks out that ’tis summer, most
generally, when they does gits ’em. After that it
don’t count; they jest works, lots of ’em, summer
or winter, school or no school.”
</p>
<p>
“The age! Do you mean that they let mere
children, twelve years old, work in those mills?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
</p>
<p>
For a moment Patty stared silently. Then she
shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“I reckon mebbe ye don’t know much about it,”
she said wearily. “They don’t wait till they’s
twelve. They jest says they’s twelve. Nellie
Magoon’s eleven, an’ Bess is ten, an’ Susie McDermot
ain’t but nine—but they’s all twelve on
the mill books. Sam’s jest a-learnin’ Maggie ter
say she’s twelve even now, an’ the minute she’s
big enough ter work she will be twelve. It makes
me jest sick; an’ that’s why I can’t bear ter hear
her say it.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret shuddered. Her face lost a little of
its radiant glow, and her hand trembled as she
raised it to her head.
</p>
<p>
“You are right—I did not know,” she said
faintly. “There must be something that can be
done. There <em>must</em> be. I will see.”
</p>
<p>
And she did see. That night she once more
followed her guardian into the little den off the
library.
</p>
<p>
“It’s business again,” she began, smiling
faintly; “and it’s the mills. May I speak to you
a moment?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course you may,” cried the man, trying to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
make his voice so cordial that there should be
visible in his manner no trace of his real dismay
at her request. “What is it?”
</p>
<p>
Margaret did not answer at once. Her head
drooped forward a little. She had seated herself
near the desk, and her left hand and arm rested
along the edge of its smooth flat top. The man’s
gaze drifted from her face to the arm, the slender
wrist and the tapering fingers so clearly outlined
in all their fairness against the dark mahogany,
and so plainly all unfitted for strife or struggle.
With a sudden movement he leaned forward and
covered the slim fingers with his own warm-clasping
hand.
</p>
<p>
“Margaret, dear child, don’t!” he begged. “It
breaks my heart to see you like this. You are
carrying the whole world on those two frail shoulders
of yours.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no, it’s not the whole world at all,” protested
the girl. “It’s only a wee small part of it—and
such a defenseless little part, too. It’s the
children down at the mills.”
</p>
<p>
Unconsciously the man straightened himself.
His clasp on the outstretched hand loosened until
Margaret, as if in answer to the stern determination
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
of his face, drew her hand away and raised
her head until her eyes met his unfalteringly.
</p>
<p>
“It is useless, of course, to pretend not to understand,”
he began stiffly. “I suppose that that
altogether too officious young McGinnis has been
asking your help for some of his pet schemes.”
</p>
<p>
“On the contrary, Mr. McGinnis has not
spoken to me of the mill workers,” corrected
Margaret, quietly, but with a curious little thrill
that resolved itself into a silent exultation that
there was then at least one at the mills on whose
aid she might count. “I have not seen him, indeed,
since that first morning I met him,” she
finished coldly. Though Margaret would not
own it to herself, the fact that she had not seen
the young man, Robert McGinnis, had surprised
and disappointed her not a little—Margaret Kendall
was not used to having her presence and her
gracious invitations ignored.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, then you haven’t seen him,” murmured
her guardian; and there was a curious intonation
of relief in his voice. “Who, then, has been talking
to you?”
</p>
<p>
“No one—in the way you mean. Patty inadvertently
mentioned it to-day, and I questioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
her. I was shocked and distressed. Those little
children—just think of it—twelve years old, and
working in the mills!”
</p>
<p>
The man made a troubled gesture.
</p>
<p>
“But, my dear Margaret, I did not put them
there. Their parents did it.”
</p>
<p>
“But you could refuse to take them.”
</p>
<p>
“Why should I?” he shrugged. “They would
merely go into some other man’s mill.”
</p>
<p>
“But you don’t know the worst of it,” moaned
the girl. “They’ve lied to you. They aren’t even
twelve, some of them. They’re babies of nine and
ten!”
</p>
<p>
She paused expectantly, but he did not speak.
He only turned his head so that she could not see
his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“You did not know it, of course,” she went
on feverishly. “But you do now. And surely
now, <em>now</em> you can do something.”
</p>
<p>
Still he was silent. Then he turned sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Margaret, I beg of you to believe me when I
say that you do not understand the matter at all.
Those people are poor. They need the money.
You would deprive some of the families of two-thirds
of their means of support if you took away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
what the children earn. Help them, pity them,
be as charitable as you like. That is well and
good; but, Margaret, don’t, for heaven’s sake,
let your heart run away with your head when it
comes to the business part of it!”
</p>
<p>
“Business!—with babies nine years old!”
</p>
<p>
The man sprang to his feet and walked twice
the length of the room; then he turned about
and faced the scornful eyes of the girl by the
desk.
</p>
<p>
“Margaret, don’t look at me as if you thought
I was a fiend incarnate. I regret this sort of
thing as much as you do. Indeed I do. But my
hands are tied. I am simply a part of a great
machine—a gigantic system, and I must run my
mills as other men do. Surely you must see that.
Just think it over, and give me the credit at least
for knowing a little more of the business than you
do, when I and my father before me, have been
here as many years as you have days. Come,
please don’t let us talk of this thing any more to-night.
You are tired and overwrought, and I
don’t think you realize yourself what you are
asking.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well, I will go,” sighed Margaret, rising
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
wearily to her feet. “But I can’t forget it.
There must be some way out of it. There
must be some way out of it—somehow—some
time.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<p>
There came a day when there seemed to
be nothing left to do for Patty. Maggie
was well, and at play again in the tiny
yard. The yard itself was no longer strewn with
tin cans and bits of paper, nor did the gate hang
half-hinged in slovenly decrepitude. The house
rejoiced in new paper, paint, and window-glass,
and the roof showed a spotted surface that would
defy the heaviest shower. Within, before a cheery
fire, Patty sewed industriously on garments which
Miss Kendall no wise needed, but for which Miss
Kendall would pay much money.
</p>
<p>
Patty did not work in the mills now; Margaret
had refused to let her go back, saying that she
wanted lots of sewing done, and Patty could do
that instead. Patty’s own wardrobe, as well as
that of the child, Maggie, was supplied for a year
ahead; and the pantry and the storeroom of the
little house fairly groaned with good things to eat.
Even Sam, true to Margaret’s promise, was not
“left out,” as was shown by his appearance. Sam,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
stirred by the girl’s cheery encouragement and
tactful confidence, held up his head sometimes
now with a trace of his old manliness, and had
even been known to keep sober for two whole days
at a time.
</p>
<p>
There did, indeed, seem nothing left to do for
Patty, and Margaret found herself with the old
idleness on her hands.
</p>
<p>
At Hilcrest Mrs. Merideth and her brothers
were doing everything in their power to make
Margaret happy. They were frightened and dismayed
at the girl’s “infatuation for that mill
woman,” as they termed Margaret’s interest in
Patty; and they had ever before them the haunting
vision of the girl’s childhood morbidness,
which they so feared to see return.
</p>
<p>
To the Spencers, happiness for Margaret meant
pleasure, excitement, and—as Ned expressed it—“something
doing.” At the first hint, then, of
leisure on the part of Margaret, these three vied
with each other to fill that leisure to the brim.
</p>
<p>
Two or three guests were invited—just enough
to break the monotony of the familiar faces,
though not enough to spoil the intimacy and
render outside interests easy. It was December,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
and too late for picnics, but it was yet early in the
month, and driving and motoring were still possible,
and even enjoyable. The goal now was not
a lake or a mountain, to be sure; but might be a
not too distant city with a matinée or a luncheon
to give zest to the trip.
</p>
<p>
Ned, in particular, was indefatigable in his
efforts to please; and Margaret could scarcely
move that she did not find him at her elbow with
some suggestion for her gratification ranging all
the way from a dinner-party to a footstool.
</p>
<p>
Margaret was not quite at ease about Ned.
There was an exclusiveness in his devotions, and
a tenderness in his ministrations that made her a
little restless in his presence, particularly if she
found herself alone with him. Ned was her good
friend—her comrade. She was very sure that she
did not wish him to be anything else; and if he
should try to be—there would be an end to the
comradeship, at all events, if not to the friendship.
</p>
<p>
By way of defense against these possibilities she
adopted a playful air of whimsicality and fell to
calling him the name by which he had introduced
himself on that first day when she had seen him at
the head of the hillside path—“Uncle Ned.” She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
did not do this many times, however, for one day
he turned upon her a white face working with
emotion.
</p>
<p>
“I am not your uncle,” he burst out; and Margaret
scarcely knew whether to laugh or to cry, he
threw so much tragedy into the simple words.
</p>
<p>
“No?” she managed to return lightly. “Oh,
but you said you were, you know; and when a
man says——”
</p>
<p>
“But I say otherwise now,” he cut in, leaning
toward her until his breath stirred the hair at her
temples. “Margaret,” he murmured tremulously,
“it’s not ‘uncle,’—but there’s something else—a
name that——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but I couldn’t learn another,” interrupted
Margaret, with nervous precipitation, as she rose
hurriedly to her feet, “so soon as this, you know!
Why, you’ve just cast me off as a niece, and it
takes time for me to realize the full force of that
blow,” she finished gayly, as she hurried away.
</p>
<p>
In her own room she drew a deep breath of relief;
but all day, and for many days afterward, she
was haunted by the hurt look in Ned’s eyes as she
had turned away. It reminded her of the expression
she had seen once in the pictured eyes of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
dog that had been painted by a great artist. She
remembered, too, the title of the picture:
“Wounded in the house of his friends,” and
it distressed her not a little; and yet—Ned was
her comrade and her very good friend, and that
was what he must be.
</p>
<p>
Not only this, however, caused Margaret restless
days and troubled nights: there were those
children down in the mills—those little children,
nine, ten, twelve years old. It was too cold now
to stay long on the veranda; but there was many
a day, and there were some nights, when Margaret
looked out of the east windows of Hilcrest
and gazed with fascinated, yet shrinking eyes at
the mills.
</p>
<p>
She was growing morbid—she owned that to
herself. She knew nothing at all of the mills,
and she had never seen a child at work in them;
yet she pictured great black wheels relentlessly
crushing out young lives, and she recoiled from
the touch of her trailing silks—they seemed alive
with shrunken little forms and wasted fingers.
Day after day she turned over in her mind the
most visionary projects for stopping those
wheels, or for removing those children beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
their reach. Even though her eyes might be on
the merry throngs of a gay city street—her
thoughts were still back in the mill town with
the children; and even though her body might
be flying from home at the rate of thirty or forty
miles an hour in Frank’s big six-cylinder Speeder,
her real self was back at Hilcrest with the mills
always in sight.
</p>
<p>
Once again she appealed to her guardian, but
five minutes’ talk showed her the uselessness of
anything she could say—it was true, she did not
<em>know</em> anything about it.
</p>
<p>
It was that very fact, perhaps, which first sent
her thoughts in a new direction. If, as was true,
she did not know anything about it, how better
could she remedy the situation than by finding
out something about it? And almost instantly
came the memory of her guardian’s words: “I
suppose that that altogether too officious young
McGinnis has been asking your help for some of
his schemes.”
</p>
<p>
Bobby knew. Bobby had schemes. Bobby
was the one to help her. By all means, she
would send for Bobby!
</p>
<p>
That night, in a cramped little room in one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
the mill boarding-houses, a square-jawed, gray-eyed
young man received a note that sent the
blood in a tide of red to his face, and made
his hands shake until the paper in his long,
sinewy fingers fluttered like an aspen leaf in
a breeze. Yet the note was very simple. It
read:
</p>
<p>
“Will you come, please, to see me to-morrow
night? I want to ask some questions about the
children at the mills.”
</p>
<p>
And it was signed, “Margaret Kendall.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<p>
With a relief which she did not attempt
to hide from herself, Margaret saw the
male members of the family at Hilcrest
leave early the next morning on a trip from which
they could not return until the next day; and
with a reluctance which she could not hide from
either herself or Mrs. Merideth, she said that
afternoon:
</p>
<p>
“Mr. McGinnis is coming to see me this evening,
Aunt Della. I sent for him. You know I
am interested in the children at the mills, and I
wanted to ask him some questions.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Merideth was dumb with dismay. For
some days Margaret’s apparent inactivity had
lulled her into a feeling of security. And now,
with her brothers away, the blow which they had
so dreaded for weeks had fallen—McGinnis was
coming. Summoning all her strength, Mrs.
Merideth finally managed to murmur a faint
remonstrance that Margaret should trouble herself over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
a matter that could not be helped; then
with an earnest request that Margaret should not
commit herself to any foolish promises, she fled
to her own room, fearful lest, in her perturbation,
she should say something which she would afterward
regret.
</p>
<p>
When Miss Kendall came down-stairs at eight
o’clock that night she found waiting for her in
the drawing-room—into which McGinnis had
been shown by her express orders—a young man
whose dress, attitude, and expression radiated impersonality
and business, in spite of his sumptuous
surroundings.
</p>
<p>
In directing that the young man should be
shown into the drawing-room instead of into the
more informal library or living-room, Margaret
had vaguely intended to convey to him the impression
that he was a highly-prized friend, and
as such was entitled to all honor; but she had
scarcely looked into the cold gray eyes, or
touched the half-reluctantly extended fingers
before she knew that all such efforts had been
without avail. The young man had not come
to pay a visit: he was an employee who had
obeyed the command of one in authority.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
</p>
<p>
McGinnis stood just inside the door, hat in
hand. His face was white, and his jaw stern-set.
His manner was quiet, and his voice when he
spoke was steady. There was nothing about him
to tell the girl—who was vainly trying to thaw
the stiff frigidity of his reserve—that he had spent
all day and half the night in lashing himself into
just this manner that so displeased her.
</p>
<p>
“You sent for me?” he asked quietly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” smiled the girl. “And doesn’t your
conscience prick you, sir, because I <em>had</em> to send
for you, when you should have come long ago of
your own accord to see me?” she demanded playfully,
motioning him to a seat. Then, before he
could reply, she went on hurriedly: “I wanted
to see you very much. By something that Mr.
Spencer said the other evening I suspected that
you were interested in the children who work
in the mills—particularly interested. And—you
are?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, much interested.”
</p>
<p>
“And you know them—lots of them? You
know their parents, and how they live?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I know them well—too well.” He added
the last softly, almost involuntarily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
</p>
<p>
The girl heard, and threw a quick look of
sympathy into his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Good! You are just the one I want, then,”
she cried. “And you will help me; won’t
you?”
</p>
<p>
McGinnis hesitated. An eager light had leaped
to his eyes. For a moment he dared not speak
lest his voice break through the lines of stern control
he had set for it.
</p>
<p>
“I shall be glad to give you any help I can,”
he said at last, steadily; “but Mr. Spencer, of
course, knows——” he paused, leaving his sentence
unfinished.
</p>
<p>
“But that is exactly it,” interposed Margaret,
earnestly. “Mr. Spencer does not know—at
least, he does not know personally about the mill
people, I mean. He told me long ago that you
stood between him and them, and had for a long
time. It is you who must tell me.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well, I will do my best. Just what—do
you want to know?”
</p>
<p>
“Everything. And I want not only to be told,
but to see for myself. I want you to take me
through the mills, and afterward I want to visit
some of the houses where the children live.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
</p>
<p>
“Miss Kendall!” The distressed consternation
in the man’s voice was unmistakable.
</p>
<p>
“Is it so bad as that?” questioned the girl.
“You don’t want me to see all these things? All
the more reason why I should, then! If conditions
are bad, help is needed; but before help
can be effectual, or even given at all, the conditions
must be understood. That is what I mean
to do—understand the conditions. How many
children are there employed in the mills, please?”
</p>
<p>
McGinnis hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“Well, there are some—hundreds,” he acknowledged.
“Of course many of them are twelve and
fourteen and fifteen, and that is bad enough; but
there are others younger. You see the age limit
of this state is lower than some. Many parents
bring their children here to live, so that they
can put them into the mills.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret shuddered.
</p>
<p>
“Then it is true, as Patty said. There are children
there nine and ten years old!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, even younger than that, I fear. Only
last week I turned away a man who brought a
puny little thing with a request for work. He
swore she was twelve. I’d hate to tell you how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
old—or rather, how young, she really looked. I
sent him home with a few remarks which I hope
he will remember. She was only one, however,
out of many. I am not always able to do what I
would like to do in such cases—I am not the only
man at the mills. You must realize that.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I realize it, and I understand why you
can’t always do what you wish. But just suppose
you tell me now some of the things you would
like to do—if you could.” And she smiled encouragement
straight into his eyes until in spite
of his stern resolve he forgot himself and his surroundings,
and began to talk.
</p>
<p>
Robert McGinnis was no silver-tongued orator,
but he knew his subject, and his heart was in it.
For long months he had been battling alone
against the evils that had little by little filled his
soul with horror. Accustomed heretofore only to
rebuffs and angry denunciations of his “officious
meddling,” he now suddenly found a tenderly
sympathetic ear eagerly awaiting his story, and a
pair of luminous blue eyes already glistening with
unshed tears.
</p>
<p>
No wonder McGinnis talked, and talked well.
He seemed to be speaking to the Maggie of long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
ago—the little girl who stood ready and anxious
to “divvy up” with all the world. Then suddenly
his eyes fell on the rich folds of the girl’s
dress, and on the velvety pile of the rug beneath
her feet.
</p>
<p>
“I have said too much,” he broke off sharply,
springing to his feet. “I forgot myself.”
</p>
<p>
“On the contrary you have not said half
enough,” declared the girl, rising too; “and I
mean to go over the mills at once, if you’ll be
so good as to take me. I’ll let you know when.
And come to see me again, please—without being
sent for,” she suggested merrily, adding with a
pretty touch of earnestness: “We are a committee
of two; and to do good work the committee
must meet!”
</p>
<p>
McGinnis never knew exactly how he got home
that night. The earth was beneath him, but he
did not seem to touch it. The sky was above
him—he was nearer that. But, in spite of this
nearness, the stars seemed dim—he was thinking
of the light in a pair of glorious blue eyes.
</p>
<p>
McGinnis told himself that it was because of
his mill people—this elation that possessed him.
He was grateful that they had found a friend. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
did not ask himself later whether it was also because
of his mill people that he sat up until far
into the morning, with his eyes dreamily fixed on
the note in his hand signed, “Margaret Kendall.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<p>
Frank Spencer found the mental atmosphere
of Hilcrest in confusion when he
returned from his two days’ trip. Margaret
had repeated to Mrs. Merideth the substance
of what McGinnis had told her, drawing a vivid
picture of the little children wearing out their
lives in plain sight of the windows of Hilcrest.
Mrs. Merideth had been shocked and dismayed,
though she hardly knew which she deplored the
more—that such conditions existed, or that Margaret
should know of them. At Margaret’s
avowed determination to go over the mills, and
into the operatives’ houses, she lifted her hands
in horrified protest, and begged her to report the
matter to the Woman’s Guild, and leave the
whole thing in charge of the committee.
</p>
<p>
“But don’t you see that they can’t reach the
seat of the trouble?” Margaret had objected.
“Why, even that money which I intended for
little Maggie went into a general fund, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
never reached its specified destination.” And
Mrs. Merideth could only sigh and murmur:
</p>
<p>
“But, my dear, it’s so unnecessary and so
dreadful for you to mix yourself up personally
with such people!”
</p>
<p>
When her brother came home, Mrs. Merideth
went to him. Frank was a man: surely Frank
could do something! But Frank merely grew
white and stern, and went off into his own den,
shutting himself up away from everybody. The
next morning, after a fifteen minute talk with
Margaret, he sought his sister. His face was
drawn into deep lines, and his eyes looked as if
he had not slept.
</p>
<p>
“Say no more to Margaret,” he entreated.
“It is useless. She is her own mistress, of course,
in spite of her insistence that I am still her
guardian; and she must be allowed to do as
she likes in this matter. Make her home here
happy, and do not trouble her. We must not
make her quite—hate us!” His voice broke
over the last two words, and he was gone before
Mrs. Merideth could make any reply.
</p>
<p>
Some twenty-four hours later, young McGinnis
at the mills was summoned to the telephone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
</p>
<p>
“If you are not too busy,” called a voice that
sent a quick throb of joy to the young man’s
pulse, “the other half of the committee would
like to begin work. May she come down to the
mills this afternoon at three o’clock?”
</p>
<p>
“By all means!” cried McGinnis. “Come.”
He tried to say more, but while he was searching
for just the right words, the voice murmured,
“Thank you”; and then came the click of the receiver
against the hook at the other end of the line.
</p>
<p>
The clock had not struck three that afternoon
when Margaret was ushered into the inner office
of Spencer &amp; Spencer. Only Frank was there,
for which Margaret was thankful. She avoided
Ned these days when she could. There was still
that haunting reproach in his eyes whenever they
met hers.
</p>
<p>
Frank was expecting her, and only a peculiar
tightening of his lips betrayed his disquietude as
he turned to his desk and pressed the button that
would summon McGinnis to the office.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Kendall would like to go over one of the
mills,” he said quietly, as the young man entered,
in response to his ring. “Perhaps you will be her
escort.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
</p>
<p>
Margaret gave her guardian a grateful look as
she left the office. She thought she knew just
how much the calm acceptance of the situation
had cost him, and she appreciated his unflinching
determination to give her actions the sanction of
his apparent consent. It was for this that she gave
him the grateful glance—but he did not see it.
His head was turned away.
</p>
<p>
“And what shall I show you?” asked McGinnis,
as the office door closed behind them.
</p>
<p>
“Everything you can,” returned Margaret;
“everything! But particularly the children.”
</p>
<p>
From the first deafening click-clack of the
rattling machines she drew back in consternation.
</p>
<p>
“They don’t work there—the children!” she
cried.
</p>
<p>
For answer he pointed to a little girl not far
away. She was standing on a stool, that she
might reach her work. Her face was thin and
drawn looking, with deep shadows under her eyes,
and little hollows where the roses should have
been in her cheeks. Her hair was braided and
wound tightly about her small head, though at the
temples and behind her ears it kinked into rebellious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
curls that showed what it would like to do if
it had a chance. Her ragged little skirts were
bound round and round with a stout cord so that
the hungry jaws of the machine might not snap at
any flying fold or tatter. She did not look up as
Margaret paused beside her. She dared not.
Her eyes were glued to the whizzing, whirring,
clattering thing before her, watching for broken
threads or loose ends, the neglect of which might
bring down upon her head a snarling reprimand
from “de boss” of her department.
</p>
<p>
Margaret learned many things during the next
two hours. Conversation was not easy in the
clattering din, but some few things her guide explained,
and a word or two spoke volumes sometimes.
</p>
<p>
She saw what it meant to be a “doffer,” a
“reeler,” a “silk-twister.” She saw what it might
mean if the tiny hand that thrust the empty bobbin
over the buzzing spindle-point should slip or lose
its skill. She saw a little maid of twelve who
earned two whole dollars a week, and she saw a
smaller girl of ten who, McGinnis said, was with
her sister the only support of an invalid mother at
home. She saw more, much more, until her mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
refused to grasp details and the whole scene became
one blurred vision of horror.
</p>
<p>
Later, after a brief rest—she had insisted upon
staying—she saw the “day-shift” swarm out into
the chill December night, and the “night-shift”
come shivering in to take their places; and she
grew faint and sick when she saw among them the
scores of puny little forms with tired-looking faces
and dragging feet.
</p>
<p>
“And they’re only beginning!” she moaned, as
McGinnis hurried her away. “And they’ve got to
work all night—all night!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<p>
Margaret did not sleep well in her
lavender-scented sheets that night. Always
she heard the roar and the click-clack
of the mills, and everywhere she saw the
weary little workers with their closely-bound skirts,
and their strained, anxious faces.
</p>
<p>
She came down to breakfast with dark circles
under her eyes, and she ate almost nothing, to the
great, though silent, distress of the family.
</p>
<p>
The Spencers were alone now. There would
be no more guests for a week, then would come
a merry half-dozen for the Christmas holidays.
New Year’s was the signal for a general breaking
up. The family seldom stayed at Hilcrest
long after that, though the house was not quite
closed, being always in readiness for the brothers
when either one or both came down for a week’s
business.
</p>
<p>
It was always more or less of a debatable question—just
where the family should go. There
was the town house in New York, frequently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
opened for a month or two of gaiety; and there
were the allurements of some Southern resort, or
of a trip abroad, to be considered. Sometimes it
was merely a succession of visits that occupied
the first few weeks after New Year’s, particularly
for Mrs. Merideth and Ned; and sometimes it was
only a quiet rest under some sunny sky entirely
away from Society with a capital S. The time
was drawing near now for the annual change, and
the family were discussing the various possibilities
when Margaret came into the breakfast-room.
They appealed to her at once, and asked her
opinion and advice—but without avail. There
seemed to be not one plan that interested her to
the point of possessing either merits or demerits.
</p>
<p>
“I am going down to Patty’s,” she said, a little
hurriedly, to Mrs. Merideth, when breakfast was
over. “I got some names and addresses of the
mill children yesterday from Mr. McGinnis; and
I shall ask Patty to go with me to see them. I
want to talk with the parents.”
</p>
<p>
“But, my dear, you don’t know what you are
doing,” protested Mrs. Merideth. “They are so
rough—those people. Miss Alby, our visiting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
home missionary, told me only last week how
dreadful they were—so rude and intemperate and—and
ill-odored. She has been among them.
She knows.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but don’t you see?—those are the very
people that need help, then,” returned Margaret,
wearily. “They don’t know what they are doing
to their little children, and I must tell them. I
<em>must</em> tell them. I shall have Patty with me.
Don’t worry.” And Mrs. Merideth could only
sigh and sigh again, and hurry away up-stairs to
devise an altogether more delightful plan for the
winter months than any that had yet been proposed—a
plan so overwhelmingly delightful that
Margaret could not help being interested. Of
one thing, however, Mrs. Merideth was certain—if
there was a place distant enough to silence the
roar of the mills in Margaret’s ears, that place
should be chosen if it were Egypt itself.
</p>
<p>
Patty Durgin hesitated visibly when Margaret
told her what she wanted to do, until Margaret
exclaimed in surprise, and with a little reproach
in her voice:
</p>
<p>
“Why, Patty, don’t you want to help me?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes; you don’t understand,” protested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
Patty. “It ain’t that. I want ter do it all. If
you have money for ’em, let me give it to ’em.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret was silent. Her eyes were still hurt,
still rebellious.
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t want you ter see them,” stammered
Patty, then. “I don’t want you ter feel so—so
bad.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret’s face cleared.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but I’m feeling bad now,” she asserted
cheerily; “and after I see them I’ll feel better. I
want to talk to them; don’t you see? They don’t
realize what they are doing to their children to let
them work so, and I am going to tell them.”
</p>
<p>
Patty sighed.
</p>
<p>
“Ye don’t understand,” she began, then
stopped, her eyes on the determined young face
opposite. “All right, I’ll go,” she finished, but
she shivered a little as she spoke.
</p>
<p>
And they did go, not only on that day, but on
the next and the next. Margaret almost forgot
the mills, so filled was her vision with drunken
men, untidy women, wretched babies, and cheerless
homes.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes her presence and her questions were
resented, and always they were looked upon with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
distrust. Her money, if she gave that, was welcome,
usually; but her remonstrances and her
warnings fell upon deaf, if not angry, ears. And
then Margaret perceived why Patty had said she
did not understand—there was no such thing as
making a successful appeal to the parents. She
might have spared herself the effort.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes she did not understand the words
of the dark-browed men and the slovenly women—there
were many nationalities among the operatives—but
always she understood their black
looks and their almost threatening gestures. Occasionally,
to be sure, she found a sick woman or
a discouraged man who welcomed her warmly,
and who listened to her and agreed with what she
had to say; but with them there was always the
excuse of poverty—though their Sue and Bess
and Teddy might not earn but twenty, thirty,
forty cents a day; yet that twenty, thirty, and
forty cents would buy meat and bread, and meant
all the difference between a full and an empty
stomach, perhaps, for every member of the family,
at times.
</p>
<p>
Margaret did what she could. She spent her
time and her money without stint, and went from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
house to house untiringly. She summoned young
McGinnis to her aid, and arranged for a monster
Christmas tree to be placed in the largest hall in
town; and she herself ordered the books, toys,
candies, and games for it, besides the candles
and tinsel stars to make it a vision of delight to
the weary little eyes all unaccustomed to such
glory. And yet, to Margaret it seemed that
nothing that she did counted in the least against
the much there was to be done. It was as if a
child with a teaspoon and a bowl of sand were
set to filling up a big chasm: her spoonful of
sand had not even struck bottom in that pit of
horror!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<p>
The house-party at Hilcrest was not an
entire success that Christmas. Even
the guests felt a subtle something in
the air that was not conducive to ease; while
Mrs. Merideth and her brothers were plainly
fighting a losing contest against a restlessness
that sent a haunting fear to their eyes.
</p>
<p>
Margaret, though scrupulously careful to show
every attention to the guests that courtesy demanded,
was strangely quiet, and not at all like
the merry, high-spirited girl that most of them
knew. Brandon, who was again at the house,
sought her out one day, and said low in her ear:
</p>
<p>
“If it were June and not December, and if we
were out in the auto instead of here by the fire,
I’m wondering; would I need to—watch out for
those brakes?”
</p>
<p>
The girl winced.
</p>
<p>
“No, no,” she cried; “never! I think I should
simply crawl for fear that under the wheels somewhere
would be a child, a dog, a chicken, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
even a helpless worm—something that moved
and that I might hurt. There is already so much—suffering!”
</p>
<p>
Brandon laughed uneasily and drew back, a
puzzled frown on his face. He had not meant
that she should take his jest so seriously.
</p>
<p>
It was on the day after New Year’s, when all
the guests had gone, that Margaret once more
said to her guardian that she wished to speak
to him, and on business. Frank Spencer told
himself that he was used to this sort of thing
now, and that he was resigned to the inevitable;
but his eyes were troubled, and his lips were
close-shut as he motioned the girl to precede him
into the den.
</p>
<p>
“I thought I ought to tell you,” she began,
plunging into her subject with an abruptness
that betrayed her nervousness, “I thought I
ought to tell you at once that I—I cannot go
with you when you all go away next week.”
</p>
<p>
“You cannot go with us!”
</p>
<p>
“No. I must stay here.”
</p>
<p>
“Here! Why, Margaret, child, that is impossible!—here
in this great house with only the
servants?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, no, you don’t understand; not here at
Hilcrest. I shall be down in the town—with
Patty.”
</p>
<p>
“Margaret!” The man was too dismayed to
say more.
</p>
<p>
“I know, it seems strange to you, of course”
rejoined the girl, hastily; “but you will see—you
will understand when I explain. I have
thought of it in all its bearings, and it is the
only way. I could not go with you and sing
and laugh and dance, and all the while remember
that my people back here were suffering.”
</p>
<p>
“Your people! Dear child, they are not your
people nor my people; they are their own people.
They come and go as they like. If not in my
mills, they work in some other man’s mills. You
are not responsible for their welfare. Besides,
you have already done more for their comfort
and happiness than any human being could expect
of you!”
</p>
<p>
“I know, but you do not understand. It is in a
peculiar way that they are my people—not because
they are here, but because they are poor
and unhappy.” Margaret hesitated, and then
went on, her eyes turned away from her guardian’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
face. “I don’t know as I can make you understand—as
I do. There are people, lots of them,
who are generous and kind to the poor. But they
are on one side of the line, and the poor are on
the other. They merely pass things over the line—they
never go themselves. And that is all
right. They could not cross the line if they
wanted to, perhaps. They would not know how.
All their lives they have been surrounded with
tender care and luxury; they do not know what
it means to be hungry and cold and homeless.
They do not know what it means to fight the
world alone with only empty hands.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret paused, her eyes still averted; then
suddenly she turned and faced the man sitting in
silent dismay at the desk.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you see?” she cried. “I <em>have</em> crossed
the line. I crossed it long ago when I was a little
girl. I do know what it means to be hungry and
cold and homeless. I do know what it means to
fight the world with only two small empty hands.
In doing for these people I am doing for my own.
They are my people.”
</p>
<p>
For a moment there was silence in the little
room. To the man at the desk the bottom seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
suddenly to have dropped out of his world. For
some time it had been growing on him—the
knowledge of how much the presence of this fair-haired,
winsome girl meant to him. It came to
him now with the staggering force of a blow in
the face—and she was going away. To Frank
Spencer the days suddenly stretched ahead in
empty uselessness—there seemed to be nothing
left worth while.
</p>
<p>
“But, my dear Margaret,” he said at last, unsteadily,
“we tried—we all tried to make you forget
those terrible days. You were so keenly sensitive—they
weighed too heavily on your heart.
You—you were morbid, my dear.”
</p>
<p>
“I know,” she said. “I understand better now.
Every one tried to interest me, to amuse me, to
make me forget. I was kept from everything unpleasant,
and from everybody that suffered. It
comes to me very vividly now, how careful every
one was that I should know of only happiness.”
</p>
<p>
“We wanted you to forget.”
</p>
<p>
“But I never did forget—quite. Even when
years and years had passed, and I could go everywhere
and see all the beautiful things and places I
had read about, and when I was with my friends,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
there was always something, somewhere, behind
things. Those four years in New York were vague
and elusive, as time passed. They seemed like a
dream, or like a life that some one else had lived.
But I know now; they were not a dream, and they
were not a life that some one else lived. They
were my life. I lived them myself. Don’t you
see—now?” Margaret’s eyes were luminous with
feeling. Her lips trembled; but her face glowed
with a strange exaltation of happiness.
</p>
<p>
“But what—do you mean—to do?” faltered
the man.
</p>
<p>
Margaret flushed and leaned forward eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“I am going to do all that I can, and I hope it
will be a great deal. I am going down there to
live.”
</p>
<p>
“To live—not to live, child!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Oh, I <em>know</em> now,” she went on hurriedly.
“I have been among them. Some are wicked and
some are thoughtless, but all of them need teaching.
I am going to live there among them, to
show them the better way.”
</p>
<p>
The man at the desk left his chair abruptly. He
walked over to the window and looked out. The
moon shone clear and bright in the sky. Down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
in the valley the countless gleaming windows and
the tall black chimneys showed where the mill-workers
still toiled—those mill-workers whom the
man had come almost to hate: it was because of
them that Margaret was going! He turned slowly
and walked back to the girl.
</p>
<p>
“Margaret,” he began in a voice that shook a
little, “I had not thought to speak of this—at
least, not now. Perhaps it would be better if I
never spoke of it; but I am almost forced to say
it now. I can’t let you go like this, and not—know.
I must make one effort to keep you....
If you knew that there was some one here
who loved you—who loved you with the whole
strength of his being, and if you knew that to him
your going meant everything that was loneliness
and grief, would you—could you—stay?”
</p>
<p>
Margaret started. She would not look into the
eyes that were so earnestly seeking hers. It was
of Ned, of course, that he was speaking. Of that
she was sure. In some way he had discovered
Ned’s feeling for her, had perhaps even been
asked to plead his cause with her.
</p>
<p>
“Did you ever think,” began Spencer again,
softly, “did you ever think that if you did stay,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
you might find even here some one to whom you
could show—the better way? That even here
you might do all these things you long to do,
and with some one close by your side to help
you?”
</p>
<p>
Margaret thought of Ned, of his impulsiveness,
his light-heartedness, his utter want of sympathy
with everything she had been doing the last few
weeks; and involuntarily she shuddered. Spencer
saw the sensitive quiver and drew back, touched
to the quick. Margaret struggled to her feet.
</p>
<p>
“No, no,” she cried, still refusing to meet his
eyes. “I—I cannot stay. I am sorry, believe
me, to give you pain; but I—I cannot stay!”
And she hurried from the room.
</p>
<p>
The man dropped back in his chair, his face
white.
</p>
<p>
“She does not love me, and no wonder,” he
sighed bitterly; and he went over word by word
what had been said, though even then he did not
find syllable or gesture that told him the truth—that
she supposed him merely to be playing John
Alden to his brother’s Miles Standish.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<p>
The household at Hilcrest did not break
up as early as usual that year. A few
days were consumed in horrified remonstrances
and tearful pleadings on the part of
Mrs. Merideth and Ned when Margaret’s plans
became known. Then several more days were
needed for necessary arrangements when the
stoical calm of despair had brought something
like peace to the family.
</p>
<p>
“It is not so dreadful at all,” Margaret had assured
them. “I have taken a large house not far
from the mills, and I am having it papered and
painted and put into very comfortable shape.
Patty and her family will live with me, and we
are going to open classes in simple little things
that will help toward better living.”
</p>
<p>
“But that is regular settlement work,” sighed
Mrs. Merideth.
</p>
<p>
“Is it?” smiled Margaret, a little wearily.
“Well, perhaps it is. Anyway, I hope that just
the presence of one clean, beautiful home among
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
them will do some good. I mean to try it, at all
events.”
</p>
<p>
“But are you going to do nothing but that all
the time—just teach those dreadful creatures, and—and
live there?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not,” declared Margaret, with a
bright smile. “I’ve planned a trip to New
York.”
</p>
<p>
“To New York?” Mrs. Merideth sat up suddenly,
her face alight. “Oh, that will be fine—lovely!
Why didn’t you tell us? Poor dear,
you’ll need a rest all right, I’m thinking, and we’ll
keep you just as long as we can, too.” With
lightning rapidity Mrs. Merideth had changed
their plans—in her mind. They would go to
New York, not Egypt. Egypt had seemed
desirable, but if Margaret was going to New
York, that altered the case.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but I thought you weren’t going to New
York,” laughed Margaret. “Besides—I’m going
with Patty.”
</p>
<p>
“With Patty!” If it had not been tragical
it would have been comical—Mrs. Merideth’s
shocked recoil at the girl’s words.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. After we get everything nicely to running—we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
shall have teachers to help us, you
know—Patty and I are going to New York to see
if we can’t find her sisters, Arabella and Clarabella.”
</p>
<p>
“What absurd names!” Mrs. Merideth spoke
sharply. In reality she had no interest whether
they were, or were not absurd; but they chanced
at the moment to be a convenient scapegoat for
her anger and discomfiture.
</p>
<p>
“Patty doesn’t think them absurd,” laughed
Margaret. “She would tell you that she named
them herself out of a ‘piece of a book’ she found
in the ash barrel long ago when they were children.
You should hear Patty say it really to appreciate
it. She used to preface it by some such
remark as: ‘Names ain’t like measles an’ relations,
ye know. Ye don’t have ter have ’em if ye
don’t want ’em—you can change ’em.’”
</p>
<p>
“Ugh!” shuddered Mrs. Merideth. “Margaret,
how can you—laugh!”
</p>
<p>
“Why, it’s funny, I think,” laughed Margaret
again, as she turned away.
</p>
<p>
Even the most urgent entreaties on the part of
Margaret failed to start the Spencers on their trip,
and not until she finally threatened to make the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
first move herself and go down to the town, did
they consent to go.
</p>
<p>
“But that absurd house of yours isn’t ready
yet,” protested Mrs. Merideth.
</p>
<p>
“I know, but I shall stay with Patty until it is,”
returned Margaret. “I would rather wait until
you go, as you seem so worried about the ‘break,’
as you insist upon calling it; but if you won’t, why
I must, that is all. I must be there to superintend
matters.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I suppose I shall have to go,” moaned
Mrs. Merideth, “for I simply will not have you
leave us here and go down there to live; and I
shall tell everybody, <em>everybody</em>,” she added firmly,
“that it is merely for this winter, and that we allowed
you to do it only on that one condition.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret smiled, but she made no comment—it
was enough to fight present battles without trying
to win future ones.
</p>
<p>
On the day the rest of the family left Hilcrest,
Margaret moved to Patty’s little house on the Hill
road. Her tiny room up under the eaves looked
woefully small and inconvenient to eyes that were
accustomed to luxurious Hilcrest; and the supper—which
to Patty was sumptuous in the extravagance she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
allowed herself in her visitor’s
honor—did not tempt her appetite in the least.
She told herself, however, that all this was well
and good; and she ate the supper and laid herself
down upon the hard bed with an exaltation that
rendered her oblivious to taste and feeling.
</p>
<p>
In due time the Mill House, as Margaret called
her new home, was ready for occupancy, and the
family moved in. Naming the place had given
Margaret no little food for thought.
</p>
<p>
“I want something simple and plain,” she had
said to Patty; “something that the people will
like, and feel an interest in. But I don’t want any
‘Refuges’ or ‘Havens’ or ‘Rests’ or ‘Homes’
about it. It is a home, but not the kind that begins
with a capital letter. It is just one of the mill
houses.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, why don’t ye call it the ‘Mill House,’
then, an’ done with it?” demanded Patty.
</p>
<p>
“Patty, you’re a genius! I will,” cried
Margaret. And the “Mill House” it was from
that day.
</p>
<p>
Margaret’s task was not an easy one. Both she
and her house were looked upon with suspicion,
and she had some trouble in finding the two or three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
teachers of just the right sort to help her. Even
when she had found these teachers and opened
her classes in sewing, cooking, and the care of
children, only a few enrolled themselves as pupils.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind,” said Margaret, “we shall grow.
You’ll see!”
</p>
<p>
The mill people, however, were not the only
ones that learned something during the next few
months. Margaret herself learned much. She
learned that while there were men who purposely
idled their time away and drank up their children’s
hard-earned wages, there were others who tramped
the streets in vain in search of work.
</p>
<p>
“I hain’t got nothin’ ter do yit, Miss,” one such
said to Margaret, in answer to her sympathetic inquiries.
“But thar ain’t a boss but what said if
I’d got kids I might send them along. They was
short o’ kids. I been tryin’ ter keep Rosy an’
Katy ter school. I was cal’latin’ ter make somethin’
of ’em more’n their dad an’ their mammy is:
but I reckon as how I’ll have ter set ’em ter work.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but you mustn’t,” remonstrated Margaret.
“That would spoil everything. Don’t you see
that you mustn’t? They must go to school—get
an education.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p>
The man gazed at her with dull eyes.
</p>
<p>
“They got ter eat—first,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes, I know,” interposed Margaret,
eagerly. “I understand all that, and I’ll help
about that part. I’ll give you money until you get
something to do.”
</p>
<p>
A sudden flash came into the man’s eyes. His
shoulders straightened.
</p>
<p>
“Thank ye, Miss. We be n’t charity folks.”
And he turned away.
</p>
<p>
A week later Margaret learned that Rosy and
Katy were out of school. When she looked them
up she found them at work in the mills.
</p>
<p>
This matter of the school question was a great
puzzle to Margaret. Very early in her efforts
she had sought out the public school-teachers,
and asked their help and advice. She was appalled
at the number of children who appeared
scarcely to understand that there was such a
thing as school. This state of affairs she could
not seem to remedy, however, in spite of her
earnest efforts. The parents, in many cases,
were indifferent, and the children more so. Some
of the children in the mills, indeed, were there
solely—according to the parents’ version—because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
they could not “get on” in school. Conscious
that there must be a school law, Margaret
went vigorously to work to find and enforce it.
Then, and not until then, did she realize the
seriousness of even this one phase of the problem
she had undertaken to solve.
</p>
<p>
There were other phases, too. It was not
always poverty, Margaret found, that was responsible
for setting the children to work. Sometimes
it was ambition. There were men who
could not even speak the language of their
adopted country intelligibly, yet who had ever
before them the one end and aim—money. To
this end and aim were sacrificed all the life and
strength of whatever was theirs. The minute
such a man’s boys and girls were big enough
and tall enough to be “sworn in” he got the
papers and set them to work; and never after
that, as long as they could move one dragging
little foot after the other, did they cease to pour
into the hungry treasury of his hand the pitiful
dimes and pennies that represented all they knew
of childhood.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<p>
The winter passed and the spring came.
The Mill House, even to the most skeptical
observer, showed signs of being a
success. Even already a visible influence had
radiated from its shining windows and orderly
yard; and the neighboring houses, with their
obvious attempt at “slickin’ up,” reminded one
of a small boy who has been told to wash his
face, for company was coming. The classes
boasted a larger attendance, and the stomachs
and the babies of many a family in the town
were feeling the beneficial results of the lessons.
</p>
<p>
To Margaret, however, the whole thing seemed
hopelessly small: there was so much to do, so
little done! She was still the little girl with the
teaspoon and the bowl of sand; and the chasm
yawned as wide as ever. To tell the truth, Margaret
was tired, discouraged, and homesick. For
months her strength, time, nerves, and sympathies
had been taxed to the utmost; and now that there
had come a breathing space, when the intricate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
machinery of her scheme could run for a moment
without her hand at the throttle, she was left weak
and nerveless. She was, in fact, perilously near a
breakdown.
</p>
<p>
Added to all this, she was lonely. More than
she would own to herself she missed her friends,
her home life at Hilcrest, and the tender care
and sympathetic interest that had been lavished
upon her for so many years. Here she was the
head, the strong tower of defense, the one to
whom everybody came with troubles, perplexities,
and griefs. There was no human being to
whom she could turn for comfort. They all
looked to her. Even Bobby McGinnis, when she
saw him at all—which was seldom—treated her
with a frigid deference that was inexpressibly
annoying to her.
</p>
<p>
From the Spencers she heard irregularly.
Earlier in the winter the letters had been more
frequent: nervously anxious epistles of some
length from Mrs. Merideth; stilted notes, half
protesting, half pleading, from Ned; and short,
but wonderfully sympathetic communications from
Frank. Later Frank had fallen very ill with a
fever of some sort, and Mrs. Merideth and Ned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
had written only hurried little bulletins from the
sick-room. Then had come the good news that
Frank was out of danger, though still far too weak
to undertake the long journey home. Their
letters showed unmistakably their impatience at
the delay, and questioned her as to her health
and welfare, but could set no date for their return.
Frank, in particular, was disturbed, they said.
He had not planned to leave either herself or
the mills so long, it being his intention when he
went away merely to take a short trip with his
sister and brother, and then hurry back to
America alone. As for Frank himself—he had
not written her since his illness.
</p>
<p>
Margaret was thinking of all this, and was
feeling specially forlorn as she sat alone in the
little sitting-room at the Mill House one evening
in early April. She held a book before her, but
she was not reading; and she looked up at once
when Patty entered the room.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry ter trouble ye,” began Patty, hesitatingly,
“but Bobby McGinnis is here an’ wanted
me ter ask ye——”
</p>
<p>
Margaret raised an imperious hand.
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right, Patty,” she said so sharply
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
that Patty opened wide her eyes; “but suppose
you just ask Bobby McGinnis to come here to me
and ask his question direct. I will see him now.”
And Patty, wondering vaguely what had come to
her gentle-eyed, gentle-voiced mistress—as she
insisted upon calling Margaret—fled precipitately.
</p>
<p>
Two minutes later Bobby McGinnis himself
stood tall and straight just inside the door.
</p>
<p>
“You sent for me?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
Margaret sprang to her feet. All the pent
loneliness of the past weeks and months burst
forth in a stinging whip of retort.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I sent for you.” She paused, but the
man did not speak, and in a moment she went on
hurriedly, feverishly. “I always send for you—if
I see you at all, and yet you know how hard
I’m trying to help these people, and that you are
the only one here that can help me.”
</p>
<p>
She paused again, and again the man was silent.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you know what I’m trying to do?” she
asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.” The lips closed firmly over the single
word.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t I ask you to help me? Didn’t I appoint
us a committee of two to do the work?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
Her voice shook, and her chin trembled like that
of a grieved child.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.” Again that strained, almost harsh
monosyllable.
</p>
<p>
Margaret made an impatient gesture.
</p>
<p>
“Bobby McGinnis, why don’t you help me?”
she demanded, tearfully. “Why do you stand
aloof and send to me? Why don’t you come to
me frankly and freely, and tell me the best way
to deal with these people?”
</p>
<p>
There was no answer. The man had half
turned his face so that only his profile showed
clean-cut and square-chinned against the close-shut
door.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you know that I am alone here—that I
have no friends but you and Patty?” she went on
tremulously. “Do you think it kind of you to let
me struggle along alone like this? Sometimes it
seems almost as if you were afraid——”
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid,” cut in a voice shaken with emotion.
</p>
<p>
“Bobby!” breathed Margaret in surprised dismay,
falling back before the fire in the eyes that
suddenly turned and flashed straight into hers.
“Why, Bobby!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
</p>
<p>
If the man heard, he did not heed. The bonds
of his self-control had snapped, and the torrent of
words came with a force that told how great had
been the pressure. He had stepped forward as
she fell back, and his eyes still blazed into hers.
</p>
<p>
“I <em>am</em> afraid—I’m afraid of myself,” he cried.
“I don’t dare to trust myself within sight of your
dear eyes, or within touch of your dear hands—though
all the while I’m hungry for both. Perhaps
I do let you send for me, instead of coming
of my own free will; but I’m never without the
thought of you, and the hope of catching somewhere
a glimpse of even your dress. Perhaps I
do stand aloof; but many’s the night I’ve walked
the street outside, watching the light at your window,
and many’s the night I’ve not gone home
until dawn lest some harm come to the woman I
loved so—good God! what am I saying!” he
broke off hoarsely, dropping his face into his
hands, and sinking into the chair behind him.
</p>
<p>
Over by the table Margaret stood silent, motionless,
her eyes on the bowed figure of the man
before her. Gradually her confused senses were
coming into something like order. Slowly her
dazed thoughts were taking shape.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
</p>
<p>
It was her own fault. She had brought this
thing upon herself. She should have seen—have
understood. And now she had caused all this
sorrow to this dear friend of her childhood—the
little boy who had befriended her when she
was alone and hungry and lost.... But,
after all, why should he not love her? And why
should she not—love him? He was good and
true and noble, and for years he had loved her—she
remembered now their childish compact, and
she bitterly reproached herself for not thinking of
it before—it might have saved her this....
Still, did she want to save herself this? Was it
not, after all, the very best thing that could have
happened? Where, and how could she do more
good in the world than right here with this strong,
loving heart to help her?... She loved
him, too—she was sure she did—though she
had never realized it before. Doubtless that
was half the cause of her present restlessness
and unhappiness—she had loved him all
the time, and did not know it! Surely there
was no one in the world who could so wisely
help her in her dear work. Of course she loved
him!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
</p>
<p>
Very softly Margaret crossed the room and
touched the man’s shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“Bobby, I did not understand—I did not know,”
she said gently. “You won’t have to stay away—any
more.”
</p>
<p>
“Won’t have to—stay—away!” The man was
on his feet, incredulous wonder in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“No. We—we will do it together—this work.”
</p>
<p>
“But you don’t mean—you can’t mean——”
McGinnis paused, his breath suspended.
</p>
<p>
“But I do,” she answered, the quick red flying
to her cheeks. Then, half laughing, half crying,
she faltered: “And—and I shouldn’t think you’d
make—<em>me</em> ask—<em>you</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“Margaret!” choked the man, as he fell on his
knees and caught the girl’s two hands to his lips.

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<p>
Ned Spencer returned alone to Hilcrest
about the middle of April. In spite of
their able corps of managers, the Spencers
did not often leave the mills for so long a time
without the occasional presence of one or the
other of the firm, though Ned frequently declared
that the mills were like a clock that winds itself, so
admirably adjusted was the intricate machinery of
their management.
</p>
<p>
It was not without some little embarrassment
and effort that Ned sought out the Mill House,
immediately upon his return, and called on Margaret.
</p>
<p>
“I left Della and Frank to come more slowly,”
he said, after the greetings were over. “Frank,
poor chap, isn’t half strong yet, but he was impatient
that some one should be here. For that
matter, I found things in such fine shape that I
told them I was going away again. We made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
more money when I wasn’t ‘round than when I
was!”
</p>
<p>
Margaret smiled, but very faintly. She understood
only too well that behind all this lay the
reasons why her urgent requests and pleas regarding
some of the children, had been so ignored
in the office of Spencer &amp; Spencer during the last
few months. She almost said as much to Ned, but
she changed her mind and questioned him about
Frank’s health and their trip, instead.
</p>
<p>
The call was not an unqualified success—at least
it was not a success so far as Margaret was concerned.
The young man was plainly displeased
with the cane-seated chair in which he sat, and
with his hostess’s simple toilet. The reproachful
look had gone from his eyes, it was true, but in its
place was one of annoyed disapproval that was
scarcely less unpleasant to encounter. There were
long pauses in the conversation, which neither
participant seemed able to fill. Once Margaret
tried to tell her visitor of her work, but he
was so clearly unsympathetic that she cut it short
and introduced another subject. Of McGinnis she
did not speak; time enough for that when Frank
Spencer should return and the engagement would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
have to be known. She did tell him, however, of
her plans to go to New York later in search of the
twins.
</p>
<p>
“I shall take Patty with me,” she explained,
“and we shall make it a sort of vacation. We
both need the change and the—well, it won’t be
exactly a rest, perhaps.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I fear not,” Ned returned grimly. “I do
hope, Margaret, that when Della gets home you’ll
take a real rest and change at Hilcrest. Surely by
that time you’ll be ready to cut loose from all this
sort of thing!”
</p>
<p>
Margaret laughed merrily, though her eyes
were wistful.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll wait and see how rested New York
makes me,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“But, Margaret, you surely are going to come
to Hilcrest then,” appealed Ned, “whether you
need rest or not!”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll see, Ned, we’ll see,” was all she would
say, but this time her voice had lost its merriment.
</p>
<p>
Ned, though he did not know it, and though
Margaret was loth to acknowledge it even to herself,
had touched upon a tender point. She did
long for Hilcrest, its rest, its quiet, and the tender
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
care that its people had always given her. She
longed for even one day in which she would have
no problems to solve, no misery to try to alleviate—one
day in which she might be the old care-free
Margaret. She reproached herself bitterly for all
this, however, and accused herself of being false
to her work and her dear people; but in the next
breath she would deny the accusation and say
that it was only because she was worn out and
“dead tired.”
</p>
<p>
“When the people do get home,” she said to
Bobby McGinnis one day, “when the people do
get home, we’ll take a rest, you and I. We’ll go
up to Hilcrest and just play for a day or two. It
will do us good.”
</p>
<p>
“To Hilcrest?—I?” cried the man.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly; why not?” returned Margaret
quickly, a little disturbed at the surprise in her
lover’s voice. “Surely you don’t think that the
man I’m expecting to marry can stay away from
Hilcrest; do you?”
</p>
<p>
“N-no, of course not,” murmured McGinnis;
but his eyes were troubled, and Margaret noticed
that he did not speak again for some time.
</p>
<p>
It was this, perhaps, that set her own thoughts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
into a new channel. When, after all, had she
thought of them before together—Bobby and
Hilcrest? It had always been Bobby and—the
work.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<p>
It was on a particularly beautiful morning in
June that Margaret and Patty started for
New York—so beautiful that Margaret declared
it to be a good omen.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll find them—you’ll see!” she cried.
</p>
<p>
Little Maggie had been left at the Mill House
with the teachers, and for the first time for years
Patty found herself care-free, and at liberty to enjoy
herself to the full.
</p>
<p>
“I hain’t had sech a grand time since I was a
little girl an’ went ter Mont-Lawn,” she exulted,
as the train bore them swiftly toward their destination.
“Even when Sam an’ me was married we
didn’t stop fur no play-day. We jest worked.
An’ say, did ye see how grand Sam was doin’
now?” she broke off jubilantly. “He wa’n’t
drunk once last week! Thar couldn’t no one
made him do it only you. Seems how I never
could thank ye fur all you’ve done,” she added
wistfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
</p>
<p>
“But you do thank me, Patty, every day of
your life,” contended Margaret, brightly. “You
thank me by just helping me as you do at the
Mill House.”
</p>
<p>
“Pooh! As if that was anything compared ter
what you does fur me,” scoffed Patty. “’Sides,
don’t I git pay—money, fur bein’ matron?”
</p>
<p>
In New York Margaret went immediately to a
quiet, but conveniently located hotel, where the
rooms she had engaged were waiting for them.
To Patty even this unpretentious hostelry was
palatial, as were the service and the dinner in the
great dining-room that evening.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t wonder folks likes ter be rich,” she
observed after a silent survey of the merry,
well-dressed throng about her. “I s’pose mebbe
Mis’ Magoon’d say this was worse than them
autymobiles she hates ter see so; an’ it don’t look
quite—fair; does it? I wonder now, do ye s’pose
any one of ’em ever thought of—divvyin’ up?”
</p>
<p>
A dreamy, far-away look came into the blue
eyes opposite.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps! who knows?” murmured Margaret.
“Still, <em>they</em> haven’t ever—crossed the line, perhaps,
so they don’t—<em>know</em>.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
</p>
<p>
“Huh?”
</p>
<p>
Margaret smiled.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing, Patty. I only meant that they
hadn’t lived in Mrs. Whalen’s kitchen and kept
all their wealth in a tin cup.”
</p>
<p>
“No, they hain’t,” said Patty, her eyes on the
sparkle of a diamond on the plump white finger
of a woman near by.
</p>
<p>
Margaret and Patty lost no time the next morning
in beginning their search for the twins. There
was very little, after all, that Patty knew of her
sisters since she had last seen them; but that little
was treasured and analyzed and carefully weighed.
The twins were at the Whalens’ when last heard
from. The Whalens, therefore, must be the first
ones to be looked up; and to the Whalens—as
represented by the address in Clarabella’s last
letter—the searchers proposed immediately to go.
</p>
<p>
“An’ ter think that you was bein’ looked fur
jest like this once,” remarked Patty, as they turned
the corner of a narrow, dingy street.
</p>
<p>
“Poor dear mother! how she must have suffered,”
murmured Margaret, her eyes shrinking
from the squalor and misery all about them. “I
think perhaps never until now did I realize
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
it—quite,” she added softly, her eyes moist with
tears.
</p>
<p>
“Ye see the Whalens ain’t whar they was when
you left ’em in that nice place you got fur ’em,”
began Patty, after a moment, consulting the paper
in her hand. “They couldn’t keep that, ‘course;
but Clarabella wrote they wa’n’t more’n one or two
blocks from the Alley.”
</p>
<p>
“The Alley! Oh, how I should love to see the
Alley!” cried Margaret. “And we will, Patty;
we’ll go there surely before we return home. But
first we’ll find the Whalens and the twins.”
</p>
<p>
The Whalens and the twins, however, did not
prove to be so easily found. They certainly were
not at the address given in Clarabella’s letter.
The place was occupied by strangers—people who
had never heard the name of Whalen. It took
two days of time and innumerable questions to
find anybody in the neighborhood, in fact, who
had heard the name of Whalen; but at last
patience and diligence were rewarded, and early
on the third morning Margaret and Patty started
out to follow up a clew given them by a woman
who had known the Whalens and who remembered
them well.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
</p>
<p>
Even this, however, promising as it was, did not
lead to immediate success, and it was not until the
afternoon of the fifth day that Margaret and Patty
toiled up four flights of stairs and found a little
bent old woman sitting in a green satin-damask
chair that neither Margaret nor Patty could fail
to recognize.
</p>
<p>
“Do I remember ‘Maggie’? ‘Mag of the
Alley’?” quavered the old woman excitedly in
response to Margaret’s questions. “Sure, an’ of
course I do! She was the tirror of the hull place
till she was that turned about that she got ter
be a blissed angel straight from Hiven. As if I
could iver forgit th’ swate face of Mag of the
Alley!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but you have,” laughed Margaret, “for I
myself am she.”
</p>
<p>
“Go ‘way wid ye, an’ ye ain’t that now!” cried
the old woman, peering over and through her
glasses, and finally snatching them off altogether.
</p>
<p>
“But I am. And this is Mrs. Durgin, who used
to be Patty Murphy. Don’t you remember Patty
Murphy?”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Whalen fell back in her chair.
</p>
<p>
“Saints of Hiven, an’ is it the both of yez, all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
growed up ter be sich foine young ladies as ye
be? Who’d ‘a’ thought it!”
</p>
<p>
“It is, and we’ve come to you for help,” rejoined
Margaret. “Do you remember Patty
Murphy’s sisters, the twins? We are trying to
find them, and we thought perhaps you could tell
us where they are.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Whalen shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“I knows ’em, but I don’t know whar they be
now.”
</p>
<p>
“But you did know,” interposed Patty. “You
must ‘a’ known four—five years ago, for my
little Maggie was jest born when the twins come
ter New York an’ found ye. They wrote how
they was livin’ with ye.”
</p>
<p>
The old woman nodded her head.
</p>
<p>
“I know,” she said, “I know. We was livin’
over by the Alley. But they didn’t stay. My
old man he died an’ we broke up. Sure, an’ I’m
nothin’ but a wanderer on the face of the airth
iver since, an’ I’m grown old before my time, I
am.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Mrs. Whalen, just think—just remember,”
urged Margaret. “Where did they go? Surely
you can tell that.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
</p>
<p>
Again Mrs. Whalen shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“Mike died, an’ Tom an’ Mary, they got married,
an’ Jamie, sure an’ he got his leg broke an’
they tuk him ter the horspital—bad cess to ’em!
An’ ’twas all that upsettin’ that I didn’t know
nothin’ what did happen. I seen ’em—then I
didn’t seen ’em; an’ that’s all thar was to it. An’
it’s the truth I’m a-tellin’ yez.”
</p>
<p>
It was with heavy hearts that Margaret and
Patty left the little attic room half an hour later.
They had no clew now upon which to work, and
the accomplishment of their purpose seemed almost
impossible.
</p>
<p>
In the little attic room behind them, however,
they left nothing but rejoicing. Margaret’s gifts
had been liberal, and her promises for the future
even more than that. The little bent old woman
could look straight ahead now to days when there
would be no bare cupboards and empty coal
scuttles to fill her soul with apprehension, and her
body with discomfort.
</p>
<p>
Back to the hotel went Margaret and Patty for a
much-needed night’s rest, hoping that daylight
and the morning sun would urge them to new efforts,
and give them fresh courage, in spite of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
unpromising outlook. Nor were their hopes unfulfilled.
The morning sun did bring fresh courage;
and, determined to make a fresh start, they turned
their steps to the Alley.
</p>
<p>
The Alley never forgot that visit, nor the days
that immediately followed it. There were men
and women who remembered Mag of the Alley
and Patty Murphy; but there were more who did
not. There were none, however, that did not
know who they were before the week was out,
and that had not heard the story of Margaret’s
own childhood’s experience in that same Alley
years before.
</p>
<p>
As for the Alley—it did not know itself. It
had heard, to be sure, of Christmas. It had even
experienced it, in a way, with tickets for a Salvation
Army tree or dinner. But all this occurred
in the winter when it was cold and snowy;
and it was spring now. It was not Christmas, of
course; and yet—
</p>
<p>
The entire Alley from one end to the other was
flooded with good things to eat, and with innumerable
things to wear. There was not a
child that did not boast a new toy, nor a sick
room that did not display fruit and flowers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
Even the cats and the dogs stopped their fighting,
and lay full-stomached and content in the
sun. No wonder the Alley rubbed its eyes and
failed to recognize its own face!
</p>
<p>
The Alley received, but did not give. Nowhere
was there a trace of the twins; and after a two
weeks’ search, and a fruitless following of clews
that were no clews at all, even Margaret was
forced sorrowfully to acknowledge defeat.
</p>
<p>
On the evening before the day they had set to
go home, Patty timidly said:
</p>
<p>
“I hadn’t oughter ask it, after all you’ve done;
but do ye s’pose—could we mebbe jest—jest go
ter Mont-Lawn fur a minute, jest ter look at it?”
</p>
<p>
“Mont-Lawn?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. We was so happy thar, once,” went
on Patty, earnestly. “You an’ me an’ the twins.
I hain’t never forgot it, nor what they learnt me
thar. All the good thar was in me till you come
was from them. I thought mebbe if I could
jest see it once ’twould make it easier ’bout the
other—that we can’t find the twins ye know.”
</p>
<p>
“See it? Of course we’ll see it,” cried Margaret.
“I should love to go there myself. You
know I owe it—everything, too.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
</p>
<p>
It was not for home, therefore, that Margaret
and Patty left New York the next morning, but
for Mont-Lawn. The trip to Tarrytown and
across the Hudson was soon over, as was the
short drive in the fresh morning air. Almost
before the two travelers realized where they were,
the beautiful buildings and grounds of Mont-Lawn
appeared before their eyes.
</p>
<p>
Margaret had only to tell that they, too, had
once been happy little guests in the years gone
by, to make their welcome a doubly cordial
one; and it was not long before they were
wandering about the place with eyes and ears
alert for familiar sights and sounds.
</p>
<p>
In the big pavilion where their own hungry
little stomachs had been filled, were now numerous
other little stomachs experiencing the same
delight; and in the long dormitories where their
own tired little bodies had rested were the same
long rows of little white beds waiting for other
weary little limbs and heads. Margaret’s eyes
grew moist here as she thought of that dear
mother who years before had placed over just
such a little bed the pictured face of her lost
little girl, and of how that same little girl had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
seen it and had thus found the dear mother arms
waiting for her.
</p>
<p>
It was just as Margaret and Patty turned to
leave the grounds that they saw a young woman
not twenty feet away, leading two small children.
Patty gave a sudden cry. The next moment she
bounded forward and caught the young woman
by the shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“Clarabella, Clarabella—I jest know you’re
Clarabella Murphy!”
</p>
<p>
It was a joyous half-hour then, indeed—a half-hour
of tears, laughter, questions, and ejaculations.
At the end of it Margaret and Patty
hurried away with a bit of paper on which was
the address of a certain city missionary.
</p>
<p>
All the way back to New York they talked it over—the
story of the twins’ life during all those
years; of how after months of hardship, they
had found the good city missionary, and of how she
had helped them, and they had helped her, until
now Clarabella had gone to Mont-Lawn as one
of the caretakers for the summer, and Arabella
had remained behind at the missionary’s home to
help what she could in the missionary’s daily
work.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
</p>
<p>
“And we’ll go now and see Arabella!” cried
Patty, as they stepped from the train at New
York. “An’ ain’t it jest wonderful—wonderful
ter think that we are a-goin’ ter see Arabella!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<p>
When Margaret and Patty went home
three days later they were accompanied
by a beautiful girl, whose dark eyes
carried a peculiar appeal in their velvety depths.
Some of the passengers in the car that day wondered
at such an expression on the face of one so
young and so lovely, but when the girl rose and
moved down the aisle, they wondered no longer.
She was lame, and in every movement her slender
form seemed to shrink from curious eyes.
</p>
<p>
Margaret had found her little friend far from
strong. Arabella had been taxing her strength to
the utmost, assisting the missionary through the
day, and attending night school in the evening.
She had worked and studied hard, and the strain
was telling on her already frail constitution. All
this Margaret saw at once and declared that Arabella
must come home with them to the Mill
House.
</p>
<p>
“But I couldn’t,” the girl had objected. “I
couldn’t be a burden to you and Patty.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but you won’t be,” Margaret had returned
promptly. “You’re going to be a help to Patty
and me. The Mill House needs you. The work
is increasing, and we haven’t teachers enough.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, then I’ll come,” the girl had sighed contentedly—nor
did she know that before night
Margaret had found and engaged still another
teacher, lest Arabella, when she joined the Mill
House family, should find too much to do.
</p>
<p>
Almost the first piece of news that Margaret
heard upon her return was that the family were
back at Hilcrest, and that Mrs. Merideth had already
driven down to the Mill House three times
in hopes to get tidings of Margaret’s coming.
When Mrs. Merideth drove down the fourth time
Margaret herself was there, and went back with
her to Hilcrest.
</p>
<p>
“My dear child, how dreadfully you look!”
Mrs. Merideth had exclaimed. “You are worn out,
and no wonder. You must come straight home
with me and rest.” And because Mrs. Merideth
had been tactful enough to say “rest” and not
“stay,” Margaret had gone, willingly and thankfully.
She was tired, and she did need a rest:
but she was not a little concerned to find how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
really hungry she was for the cool quiet of the
west veranda, and how eagerly she listened to the
low, sweet voices of her friends in pleasant chat—it
had been so long since she had heard low sweet
voices in pleasant chat!
</p>
<p>
The thin cheeks and hollow eyes of Frank
Spencer shocked her greatly. She had not supposed
a few short months could so change a
strong man into the mere shadow of his former
self. There was a look, too, in his eyes that
stirred her curiously; and, true to her usual
sympathetic response to trouble wherever she
found it, she set herself now to the task of driving
that look away. To this end, in spite of her
own weariness, she played and sang and devoted
herself untiringly to the amusement of the man
who was not yet strong enough to go down to
the mills.
</p>
<p>
It had been planned that immediately upon
Frank Spencer’s return, McGinnis should go to
him with the story of his love for Margaret. This
plan was abandoned, however, when Margaret
saw how weak and ill her guardian was.
</p>
<p>
“We must wait until he is better,” she said to
Bobby when he called, as had been arranged, on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
the second evening after her arrival. “He may
not be quite pleased—at first, you know,” she went
on frankly; “and I don’t want to cause him sorrow
just now.”
</p>
<p>
“Then ’twill be better if I don’t come up—again—just
yet,” stammered Bobby, miserably,
his longing eyes on her face.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I’ll let you know when he’s well enough
to see you,” returned Margaret; and she smiled
brightly. Nor did it occur to her that for a young
woman who has but recently become engaged,
she was accepting with extraordinary equanimity
the fact that she should not see her lover again
for some days. It did occur to Bobby, however,
and his eyes were troubled. They were
still troubled as he sat up far into the night,
thinking, in the shabby little room he called
home.
</p>
<p>
One by one the days passed. At Hilcrest Margaret
was fast regaining her old buoyant health,
and was beginning to talk of taking up her
“work” again, much to the distress of the family.
Frank Spencer, too, was better, though in spite of
Margaret’s earnest efforts the curiously somber
look was not gone from his eyes. It even seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
deeper and more noticeable than ever sometimes,
Margaret thought.
</p>
<p>
Never before had Margaret known quite so well
the man who had so carefully guarded her since
childhood. She suddenly began to appreciate
what he had done for her all those years. She
realized, too, with almost the shock of a surprise,
how young he had been when the charge was intrusted
to him, and what it must have meant to a
youth of twenty to have a strange, hysterical little
girl ten years old thrust upon him so unceremoniously.
She realized it all the more fully now
that the pleasant intercourse of the last two weeks
had seemed to strip from him the ten years’ difference
in their ages. They were good friends, comrades.
Day after day they had read, and sung
and walked together; and she knew that he had
exerted every effort to make her happy.
</p>
<p>
More keenly than ever now she regretted that
she must bring sorrow to him in acknowledging
her engagement to Bobby. She knew very well
that he would not approve of the marriage. Had
he not already pleaded with her to stay there at
Hilcrest as Ned’s wife? And had he not always
disapproved of her having much to say to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
McGinnis? It was hard, indeed, in the face of all this,
to tell him. But it must be done. In two days
now he was going back to the mills. There was
really no excuse for any further delay. She must
send for Bobby.
</p>
<p>
There was a thunder-storm on the night Bobby
McGinnis came to Hilcrest. The young man arrived
just before the storm broke, and was ushered
at once by Margaret herself to the little den where
Frank Spencer sat alone. Mrs. Merideth had
gone to bed with a headache, and Ned was out of
town, so Margaret had the house to herself. For
a time she wandered aimlessly about the living-room
and the great drawing-room; then she sat
down in a shadowy corner which commanded a
view of the library and of the door of the den.
She shivered at every clap of thunder, and sent a
furtive glance toward that close-shut door, wondering
if the storm outside were typical of the one
which even then might be breaking over Bobby’s
head.
</p>
<p>
It was very late when McGinnis came out of the
den and closed the door behind him—so late that
he could stop for only a few words with the girl
who hurried across the room to meet him. His
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
face was gray-white, and his whole appearance
showed the strain he had been under for the last
two hours.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Spencer was very kind,” he said huskily
in response to the question in Margaret’s eyes.
“At first, of course, he—but never mind that
part.... He has been very kind; but I—I
can’t tell you now—all that he said to me. Perhaps—some
other time.” McGinnis was plainly
very much moved. His words came brokenly and
with long pauses.
</p>
<p>
For some time after her lover had gone Margaret
waited for Frank Spencer to come out and
speak to her. But the door of the den remained
fast shut, and she finally went up-stairs without
seeing him.
</p>
<p>
The next few days at Hilcrest were hard for all
concerned. Before Margaret had come down
stairs on the morning following McGinnis’s call,
Frank Spencer had told his sister of the engagement;
and after the first shock of the news was
over, he had said constrainedly, and with averted
eyes:
</p>
<p>
“There is just one thing for us to do, Della—or
rather, for us not to do. We must not drive Margaret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
away from us. She has full right to marry
the man she loves, of course, and if—if we are too
censorious, it will result only in our losing her altogether.
It isn’t what we want to do, but what
we must do. We must accept him—or lose her.
I—I’m afraid I forgot myself at first, last night,”
went on Frank, hurriedly, “and said some pretty
harsh things. I didn’t realize <em>what</em> I was saying
until I saw the look on his face. McGinnis is a
straightforward, manly young fellow—we must not
forget that, Della.”
</p>
<p>
“But think of his po-position,” moaned Mrs.
Merideth.
</p>
<p>
Frank winced.
</p>
<p>
“I know,” he said. “But we must do our best
to remedy that. I shall advance him and increase
his pay at once, of course, and eventually he will
become one of the firm, if Margaret—marries
him.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Merideth burst into tears.
</p>
<p>
“How can you take it so calmly, Frank,” she
sobbed. “You don’t seem to care at all!”
</p>
<p>
Frank Spencer’s lips parted, then closed again.
Perhaps it was just as well, after all, that she should
not know just how much he did—care.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
</p>
<p>
“It may not be myself I’m thinking of,” he said
at last, quietly. “I want Margaret—happy.”
And he turned away.
</p>
<p>
Margaret was not happy, however, as the days
passed. In spite of everybody’s effort to act as if
everything was as usual, nobody succeeded in
doing it; and at last Margaret announced her determination
to go back to the Mill House. She
agreed, however, to call it a “visit,” for Mrs.
Merideth had cried tragically:
</p>
<p>
“But, Margaret, dear, if we are going to lose
you altogether by and by, surely you will give us
all your time now that you can!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<p>
Bobby McGinnis wondered sometimes
that summer why he was not happier.
Viewed from the standpoint of an outsider,
he surely had enough to make any man
happy. He was young, strong, and in a position
of trust and profit. He was, moreover, engaged
to the girl he loved, and that girl was everything
that was good and beautiful, and he saw her almost
every day. All this Bobby knew—and still
he wondered.
</p>
<p>
He saw a good deal of Margaret these days.
Their engagement had come to be an accepted
fact, and the first flurry of surprise and comment
had passed. The Mill House, with Patty in
charge, was steadily progressing. Margaret had
taken up her work again with fresh zest, but, true
to her promise to Mrs. Merideth, she spent many
a day, and sometimes two or three days at Hilcrest.
All this, however, did not interfere with
Bobby’s seeing her—for he, too, went to Hilcrest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>
in accordance with Margaret’s express
wishes.
</p>
<p>
“But, Bobby,” Margaret had said in response
to his troubled remonstrances, “are you not going
to be my husband? Of course you are! Then
you must come to meet my friends.” And Bobby
went.
</p>
<p>
Bobby McGinnis found himself in a new position
then. He was Mr. Robert McGinnis, the
accepted suitor of Miss Margaret Kendall, and
as such, he was introduced to Margaret’s friends.
</p>
<p>
It was just here, perhaps, that misery began for
Bobby. He was not more at ease in his new,
well-fitting evening clothes than he would have
been in the garb of Sing Sing; nor did he feel
less conspicuous among the gay throng about
Margaret’s chair than he would if he had indeed
worn the prison stripes.
</p>
<p>
As Bobby saw it, he <em>was</em> in prison, beyond the
four walls of which lay a world he had never seen—a
world of beautiful music and fine pictures; a
world of great books and famous men; a world
of travel, ease, and pleasure. He could but dimly
guess the meaning of half of what was said; and
the conversation might as well have been conducted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
in a foreign language so far as there being
any possibility of his participating in it. Big, tall,
and silent, he stood as if apart. And because he
was apart—he watched.
</p>
<p>
He began to understand then, why he was unhappy—yet
he was not watching himself, he was
watching Margaret. She knew this world—this
world that was outside his prison walls; and she
was at home in it. There was a light in her eye
that he had never brought there, though he had
seen it sometimes when she had been particularly
interested in her work at the Mill House. As he
watched her now, he caught the quick play of
color on her cheeks, and heard the ring of enthusiasm
in her voice. One subject after another
was introduced, and for each she had question,
comment, or jest. Not once did she appeal to
him. But why should she, he asked himself
bitterly. They—those others near her, knew this
world. He did not know it.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the mills were spoken of, and she
was questioned about her work. Then, indeed,
she turned to him—but he was not the only one
to whom she turned: she turned quite as frequently
to the man who was seldom far away from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
the sound of her voice when she was at Hilcrest—Frank
Spencer.
</p>
<p>
McGinnis had a new object for his brooding
eyes then; and it was not long before he saw that
it was to this same Frank Spencer that Margaret
turned when subjects other than the mills were
under discussion. There seemed to be times, indeed,
when she apparently heard only his voice,
and recognized only his presence, so intimate was
the sympathy between them. McGinnis saw
something else, too—he saw the look in Frank
Spencer’s eyes; and after that he did not question
again the cause of his own misery.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes McGinnis would forget all this, or
would call it the silly fears of a jealous man who
sees nothing but adoration in every eye turned
upon his love. Such times were always when
Margaret was back at the Mill House, and when
it seemed as if she, too, were inside his prison
walls with him, leaving that hated, unknown world
shut forever out. Then would come Hilcrest—and
the reaction.
</p>
<p>
“She does not love me,” he would moan night
after night as he tossed in sleepless misery. “She
does not love me, but she does not know it—yet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
She is everything that is good and beautiful
and kind; but I never, never can make her
happy. I might have known—I might have
known!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<p>
The Spencers remained at Hilcrest nearly
all summer with only a short trip or two
on the part of Mrs. Merideth and Ned.
The place was particularly cool and delightful in
summer, and this season it was more so than
usual. House-parties had always been popular
at Hilcrest, and never more so than now. So
popular, indeed, were they that Margaret suspected
them to be sometimes merely an excuse
to gain her own presence at Hilcrest.
</p>
<p>
There were no guests, however, on the Monday
night that the mills caught fire. Even Margaret
was down at the Mill House. Mrs. Merideth,
always a light sleeper, was roused by the first
shrill blast of the whistle. From her bed she
could see the lurid glow of the sky, and with a
cry of terror she ran to the window. The next
moment she threw a bath-robe over her shoulders
and ran to Frank Spencer’s room across the
hall.
</p>
<p>
“Frank, it’s the mills—they’re all afire!” she
called frenziedly. “Oh, Frank, it’s awful!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
</p>
<p>
From behind the closed door came a sudden
stir and the sound of bare feet striking the floor;
then Frank’s voice.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be out at once. And, Della, see if Ned’s
awake, and if you can call up Peters, please. We
shall want a motor car.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Merideth wrung her hands.
</p>
<p>
“Frank—Frank—I can’t have you go—I can’t
have you go!” she moaned hysterically; yet all
the while she was hurrying to the telephone that
would give the alarm and order the car that would
take him.
</p>
<p>
In five minutes the house was astir from end to
end. Lights flashed here and there, and terrified
voices and hurried footsteps echoed through
the great halls. Down in the town the whistles
were still shrieking their frenzied summons, and
up in the sky the lurid glow of the flames was
deepening and spreading. Then came a hurried
word from McGinnis over the telephone.
</p>
<p>
The fire had caught in one of the buildings
that had been closed for repairs, which accounted
for the great headway it had gained before it
was discovered. There was a strong east wind,
and the fire was rapidly spreading, and had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
already attacked the next building on the west.
The operatives were in a panic. There was danger
of great loss of life, and all help possible was
needed.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Merideth, who heard, could only wring
her hands and moan again: “I can’t have them
go—I can’t have them go!” Yet five minutes
later she sent them off, both Frank and Ned,
with a fervid “God keep you” ringing in their
ears.
</p>
<p>
Down in the Mill House all was commotion.
Margaret was everywhere, alert, capable, and
untiring.
</p>
<p>
“We can do the most good by staying right
here and keeping the house open,” she said.
“We are so near that they may want to bring
some of the children here, if there should be any
that are hurt or overcome. At all events, we’ll
have everything ready, and we’ll have hot coffee
for the men.”
</p>
<p>
Almost immediately they came—those limp,
unconscious little forms borne in strong, tender
arms. Some of the children had only fainted;
others had been crushed and bruised in the mad
rush for safety. Before an hour had passed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
Mill House looked like a hospital, and every
available helper was pressed into service as a
nurse.
</p>
<p>
Toward morning a small boy, breathless and
white-faced, rushed into the main hall.
</p>
<p>
“They’re in there—they’re in there—they hain’t
come out yet—an’ the roof has caved in!” he
panted. “They’ll be burned up—they’ll be burned
up!”
</p>
<p>
Margaret sprang forward.
</p>
<p>
“But I thought they were all out,” she cried.
“We heard that every one was out. Who’s in
there? What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
The boy gasped for breath.
</p>
<p>
“The boss, Bobby McGinnis an’ Mr. Spencer—Mr.
Frank Spencer. They went——”
</p>
<p>
With a sharp cry Margaret turned and ran
through the open door to the street, nor did she
slacken her pace until she had reached the surging
crowds at the mills.
</p>
<p>
From a score of trembling lips she learned the
story, told in sobbing, broken scraps of words.
</p>
<p>
Frank and Ned Spencer, together with McGinnis,
had worked side by side with the firemen in clearing
the mills of the frightened men, women, and children.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
It was not until after word came that all
were out that Frank Spencer and McGinnis were
reported to be still in the burning building. Five
minutes later there came a terrific crash, and a
roar of flames as a portion of the walls and the roof
caved in. Since then neither one of the two men
had been seen.
</p>
<p>
There was more—much more: tales of brave
rescues, and stories of children restored to frantically
outstretched arms; but Margaret did not
hear. With terror-glazed eyes and numbed senses
she shrank back from the crowd, clasping and unclasping
her hands in helpless misery. There Ned
found her.
</p>
<p>
“Margaret, you! and here? No, no, you must
not. You can do no good. Let me take you
home, do, dear,” he implored.
</p>
<p>
Margaret shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“Ned, he can’t be dead—not dead!” she
moaned.
</p>
<p>
Ned’s face grew white. For an instant he was
almost angry with the girl who had so plainly
shown that to her there was but one man that had
gone down into the shadow of death. Then his
eyes softened. After all, it was natural, perhaps,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
that she should think of her lover, and of him only,
in this first agonized moment.
</p>
<p>
“Margaret, dear, come home,” he pleaded.
</p>
<p>
“Ned, he isn’t dead—not dead,” moaned the
girl again. “Why don’t you tell me he isn’t
dead?”
</p>
<p>
Ned shuddered. His eyes turned toward the
blackened, blazing pile before him—as if a man
could be there, and live! Margaret followed his
gaze and understood.
</p>
<p>
“But he—he may not have gone in again, Ned.
He may not have gone in again,” she cried feverishly.
“He—he is out here somewhere. We will
find him. Come! Come—we must find him!”
And she tugged at his arm.
</p>
<p>
Ned caught at the straw.
</p>
<p>
“No, no, not you—you could do nothing here;
but I’ll go,” he said. “And I’ll promise to bring
you the very first word that I can. Come, now
you’ll go home, surely!”
</p>
<p>
Margaret gazed about her. Everywhere were
men, confusion, smoke and water. The fire was
clearly under control, and the flames were fast
hissing into silence. Over in the east the sun was
rising. A new day had begun, a day of—— She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
suddenly remembered the sufferers back at the
Mill House. She turned about sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I’ll go,” she choked. “I’ll go back to
the Mill House. I <em>can</em> do something there, and I
can’t do anything here. But, Ned, you will bring
me word—soon; won’t you?—soon!” And before
Ned could attempt to follow her, she had
turned and was lost in the crowd.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
<p>
Tuesday was a day that was not soon
forgotten at the mills. Scarcely waiting
for the smoking timbers to cool, swarms
of workmen attacked the ruins and attempted to
clear their way to the point where Spencer and
McGinnis had last been seen. Fortunately, that
portion of the building had only been touched by
the fire, and it was evident that the floors and roof
had been carried down with the fall of those nearest
to it. For this reason there was the more hope
of finding the bodies unharmed by fire—perhaps,
even, of finding a spark of life in one or both of
them. This last hope, however, was sorrowfully
abandoned when hour after hour passed with no
sign of the missing men.
</p>
<p>
All night they worked by the aid of numerous
electric lights hastily placed to illuminate the
scene; and when Wednesday morning came, a
new shift of workers took up the task that had
come to be now merely a search for the dead. So
convinced was every one of this that the men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
gazed with blanched faces into each other’s eyes
when there came a distinct rapping on a projecting
timber near them. In the dazed silence that
followed a faint cry came from beneath their feet.
</p>
<p>
With a shout and a ringing cheer the men fell
to work—it was no ghost, but a living human
voice that had called! They labored more cautiously
now, lest their very zeal for rescue should
bring defeat in the shape of falling brick or timber.
</p>
<p>
Ned Spencer, who had not left the mills all
night, heard the cheer and hurried forward. It
was he who, when the men paused again, called:
</p>
<p>
“Frank, are you there?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Ned.” The voice was faint, but distinctly
audible.
</p>
<p>
“And McGinnis?”
</p>
<p>
There was a moment’s hesitation. The listeners
held their breath—perhaps, after all, they had
been dreaming and there was no voice! Then it
came again.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. He’s lying beside me, but he’s unconscious—or
dead.” The last word was almost inaudible,
so faint was it; but the tightening of
Ned’s lips showed that he had heard it, none the
less. In a moment he stooped again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
</p>
<p>
“Keep up your courage, old fellow! We’ll
have you out of that soon.” Then he stepped
aside and gave the signal for the men to fall to
work again.
</p>
<p>
Rapidly, eagerly, but oh, so cautiously, they
worked. At the next pause the voice was nearer,
so near that they could drop through a small hole
a rubber tube four feet long, lowering it until
Spencer could put his mouth to it. Through this
tube he was given a stimulant, and a cup of strong
coffee.
</p>
<p>
They learned then a little more of what had
happened. The two men were on the fourth floor
when the crash came. They had been swept
down and had been caught between the timbers
in such a way that as they lay where they had
been flung, a roof three feet above their heads
supported the crushing weight above. Spencer
could remember nothing after the first crash, until
he regained consciousness long afterward, and
heard the workmen far above him. It was then
that he had tapped his signal on the projecting
timber. He had tapped three times before he had
been heard. At first it was dark, he said, and he
could not see, but he knew that McGinnis was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
near him. McGinnis had spoken once, then had
apparently dropped into unconsciousness. At all
events he had said nothing since. Still, Spencer
did not think he was dead.
</p>
<p>
Once more the rescuers fell to work, and it was
then that Ned Spencer hurried away to send a
message of hope and comfort to Mrs. Merideth,
who had long since left the great house on the
hill and had come down to the Mill House to be
with Margaret. To Margaret Ned wrote the one
word “Come,” and as he expected, he had not
long to wait.
</p>
<p>
“You have found him!” cried the girl, hurrying
toward him. “Ned, he isn’t dead!”
</p>
<p>
Ned smiled and put out a steadying hand.
</p>
<p>
“We hope not—and we think not. But he is
unconscious, Margaret. Don’t get your hopes
too high. I had to send for you—I thought you
ought to know—what we know.”
</p>
<p>
“But where is he? Have you seen him?”
</p>
<p>
Ned shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“No; but Frank says——”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Frank!</em> But you said Frank was unconscious!”
</p>
<p>
“No, no—they aren’t both unconscious—it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
only McGinnis. It is Frank who told us the story.
He—why, Margaret!” But Margaret was gone;
and as Ned watched her flying form disappear
toward the Mill House, he wondered if, after
all, the last hours of horror had turned her
brain. In no other way could he account for her
words, and for this most extraordinary flight just
at the critical moment when she might learn the
best—and the worst—of what had come to her
lover. To Ned it seemed that the girl must be
mad. He could not know that in Margaret’s little
room at the Mill House some minutes later, a girl
went down on her knees and sobbed:
</p>
<p>
“To think that ’twasn’t Bobby at all that I was
thinking of—’twasn’t Bobby at all! ’Twas never
Bobby that had my first thought. ’Twas always——”
Even to herself Margaret would not
say the name, and only her sobs finished the
sentence.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>
<p>
Robert McGinnis was not dead when
he was tenderly lifted from his box-like
prison, but he was still unconscious. In
spite of their marvelous escape from death, both
he and his employer were suffering from breaks
and bruises that would call for the best of care
and nursing for weeks to come; and it seemed
best for all concerned that this care and nursing
should be given at the Mill House. A removal
to Hilcrest in their present condition would not be
wise, the physicians said, and the little town hospital
was already overflowing with patients.
There was really no place but the Mill House,
and to the Mill House they were carried.
</p>
<p>
At the Mill House everything possible was done
for their comfort. Two large airy rooms were
given up to their use, and the entire household
was devoted to their service. The children that
had been brought there the night of the fire were
gone, and there was no one with whom the two
injured men must share the care and attention
that were lavished upon them. Trained nurses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
were promptly sent for, and installed in their positions.
Aside from these soft-stepping, whitecapped
women, Margaret and the little lame Arabella
were the most frequently seen in the sickrooms.
</p>
<p>
“We’re the ornamental part,” Margaret would
say brightly. “We do the reading and the singing
and the amusing.”
</p>
<p>
Arabella was a born nurse, so both the patients
said. There was something peculiarly soothing
in the soft touch of her hands and in the low tones
of her voice. She was happy in it, too. Her eyes
almost lost their wistful look sometimes, so absorbed
would she be in her self-appointed task.
</p>
<p>
As for Margaret—Margaret was a born nurse,
too, and both the patients said that; though one
of the patients, it is true, complained sometimes
that she did not give him half a chance to know
it. Margaret certainly did not divide her time
evenly. Any one could see that. No one, however—not
even Frank Spencer himself—could
really question the propriety of her devoting herself
more exclusively to young McGinnis, the man
she had promised to marry.
</p>
<p>
Margaret was particularly bright and cheerful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
these days; but to a close observer there was
something a little forced about it. No one seemed
to notice it, however, except McGinnis. He
watched her sometimes with somber eyes; but
even he said nothing—until the day before he was
to leave the Mill House. Then he spoke.
</p>
<p>
“Margaret,” he began gently, “there is something
I want to say to you. I am going to be
quite frank with you, and I want you to be so
with me. Will you?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, of—of course,” faltered Margaret,
nervously, her eyes carefully avoiding his steady
gaze. Then, hopefully: “But, Bobby, really I
don’t think you should talk to-day; not—not
about anything that—that needs that tone of
voice. Let’s—let’s read something!”
</p>
<p>
Bobby shook his head decidedly.
</p>
<p>
“No. I’m quite strong enough to talk to-day.
In fact, I’ve wanted to say this for some time, but
I’ve waited until to-day so I could say it. Margaret,
you—you don’t love me any longer.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh—Bobby! Why, <em>Bobby</em>!” There was
dismayed distress in Margaret’s voice. When
one has for some weeks been trying to lash one’s
self into a certain state of mind and heart for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
express sake of some other one, it is distressing to
have that other one so abruptly and so positively
show that one’s labor has been worse than useless.
</p>
<p>
“You do not, Margaret—you know that you do
not.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Bobby, what—what makes you say
such a dreadful thing,” cried the girl, reaching
blindly out for some support that would not fail.
“As if—I didn’t know my own mind!”
</p>
<p>
Bobby was silent. When he spoke again his
voice shook a little.
</p>
<p>
“I will tell you what makes me say it. For
some time I’ve suspected it—that you did not love
me; but after the fire I—I knew it.”
</p>
<p>
“You knew it!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. When a girl loves a man, and that man
has come back almost from the dead, she goes to
him first—if she loves him. When Frank Spencer
and I were brought into the hall down-stairs that
Wednesday morning, the jar or something brought
back my senses for a moment, just long enough
for me to hear your cry of ‘Frank,’ and to see you
hurry to his side.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret caught her breath sharply. Her face
grew white.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
</p>
<p>
“But, Bobby, you—you were unconscious, I
supposed,” she stammered faintly. “I didn’t
think you could answer me if—if I did go to you.”
</p>
<p>
“But you did not—come—to—see.” The
words were spoken gently, tenderly, sorrowfully.
</p>
<p>
Margaret gave a low cry and covered her face
with her hands. A look that was almost relief
came to the man’s face.
</p>
<p>
“There,” he sighed. “Now you admit it. We
can talk sensibly and reasonably. Margaret, why
have you tried to keep it up all these weeks, when
it was just killing you?”
</p>
<p>
“I wanted to make—you—happy,” came
miserably from behind the hands.
</p>
<p>
“And did you think I could be made happy
that way—by your wretchedness?”
</p>
<p>
There was no answer.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve seen it coming for a long time,” he went
on gently, “and I did not blame you. I could
never have made you happy, and I knew it almost
from the first. I wasn’t happy, either—because I
couldn’t make you so. Perhaps now I—I shall
be happier; who knows?” he asked, with a wan
little smile.
</p>
<p>
Margaret sobbed. It was so like Bobby—to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
belittle his own grief, just to make it easier for
her!
</p>
<p>
“You see, it was for only the work that you
cared for me,” resumed the man after a minute.
“You loved that, and you thought you loved me.
But it was only the work all the time, dear. I
understand that now. You see I watched you—and
I watched him.”
</p>
<p>
“Him!” Margaret’s hands were down, and she
was looking at Bobby with startled eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I used to think he loved you even
then, but after the fire, and I heard your cry of
‘Frank’——”
</p>
<p>
Margaret sprang to her feet.
</p>
<p>
“Bobby, Bobby, you don’t know what you are
saying,” she cried agitatedly. “Mr. Spencer
does not love me, and he never loved me. Why,
Bobby, he couldn’t! He even pleaded with me
to marry another man.”
</p>
<p>
“He pleaded with you!” Bobby’s eyes were
puzzled.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Now, Bobby, surely you understand
that he doesn’t love me. Surely you must see!”
</p>
<p>
Bobby threw a quick look into the flushed,
quivering face; then hastily turned his eyes away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I see,” he said almost savagely. And
he did see—more than he wanted to. But he did
not understand: how a man <em>could</em> have the love
of Margaret Kendall and not want it, was beyond
the wildest flights of his fancy.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>CHAPTER XL</h2>
<p>
Frank Spencer had already left the
Mill House and gone to Hilcrest when
McGinnis was well enough to go back
to his place in the mills. The mills, in spite of
the loss of the two buildings (which were being
rapidly rebuilt) were running full time, and needed
him greatly, particularly as the senior member of
the firm had not entirely regained his old health
and strength.
</p>
<p>
For some time after McGinnis went away, Margaret
remained at the Mill House; but she was
restless and unhappy in the position in which she
found herself. McGinnis taught an evening class
at the Mill House, and she knew that it could not
be easy for him to see her so frequently now that
the engagement was broken. Margaret blamed
herself bitterly, not for the broken engagement,
but for the fact that there had ever been any engagement
at all. She told herself that she ought
to have known that the feeling she had for Bobby
was not love—and she asked herself scornfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
what she thought of a young woman who could
give that love all unsought to a man who was so
very indifferent as to beg her favor for another!
Those long hours of misery when the mills burned
had opened Margaret’s eyes; and now that her
eyes were opened, she was frightened and
ashamed.
</p>
<p>
It seemed to Margaret, as she thought of it, that
there was no way for her to turn but to leave both
the Mill House and Hilcrest for a time. Bobby
would be happier with her away, and the Mill
House did not need her—Clarabella had come
from New York, and had materially strengthened
the teaching force. As for Hilcrest—she certainly
would not stay at Hilcrest anyway—now. Later,
when she had come to her senses, perhaps—but
not now.
</p>
<p>
It did not take much persuasion on the part of
Margaret to convince Mrs. Merideth that a winter
abroad would be delightful—just they two together.
The news of Margaret’s broken engagement
had been received at Hilcrest with a joyous
relief that was nevertheless carefully subdued in
the presence of Margaret herself; but Mrs. Merideth
could not conceal her joy that she was to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
take Margaret away from the “whole unfortunate
affair,” as she expressed it to her brothers. Frank
Spencer, however, was not so pleased at the proposed
absence. He could see no reason for Margaret’s
going, and one evening when they were
alone together in the library he spoke of it.
</p>
<p>
“But, Margaret, I don’t see why you must go,”
he protested.
</p>
<p>
For a moment the girl was silent; then she
turned swiftly and faced him.
</p>
<p>
“Frank, Bobby McGinnis was my good friend.
From the time when I was a tiny little girl he
has been that. He is good and true and noble,
but I have brought him nothing but sorrow. He
will be happier now if I am quite out of his sight
at present. I am going away.”
</p>
<p>
Frank Spencer stirred uneasily.
</p>
<p>
“But you will be away—from him—if you are
here,” he suggested.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but if I’m here I shall be there,” contested
Margaret with a haste that refused to consider
logic; then, as she saw the whimsical smile
come into the man’s eyes, she added brokenly:
“Besides, I want to get away—quite away from
my work.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
</p>
<p>
Spencer grew sober instantly. The whimsical
look in his eyes gave place to one of tender sympathy.
</p>
<p>
“You poor child, of course you do, and no
wonder! You are worn out with the strain,
Margaret.”
</p>
<p>
She raised a protesting hand.
</p>
<p>
“No, no, you do not understand. I—I have
made a failure of it.”
</p>
<p>
“A failure of it!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I want to get away—to look at it from
a distance, and see if I can’t find out what is the
trouble with it, just as—as artists do, you know,
when they paint a picture.” There was a feverishness
in Margaret’s manner and a tremulousness
in her voice that came perilously near to
tears.
</p>
<p>
“But, my dear Margaret,” argued the man,
“there’s nothing the matter with it. It’s no
failure at all. You’ve done wonders down there
at the Mill House.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret shook her head slowly.
</p>
<p>
“It’s so little—so very little compared to what
ought to be done,” she sighed. “The Mill House
is good and does good, I acknowledge; but it’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
so puny after all. It’s like a tiny little oasis in
a huge desert of poverty and distress.”
</p>
<p>
“But what—what more could you do?” ventured
the man.
</p>
<p>
Margaret rose, and moved restlessly around
the room.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” she said at last. “That’s
what I mean to find out.” She stopped suddenly,
facing him. “Don’t you see? I touch
only the surface. The great cause behind things
I never reach. Sometimes it seems as if it were
like that old picture—where was it? in Pilgrim’s
Progress?—of the fire. On one side is the man
trying to put it out; on the other, is the evil
one pouring on oil. My two hands are the two
men. With one I feed a hungry child, or nurse
a sick woman; with the other I make more
children hungry and more women sick.”
</p>
<p>
“Margaret, are you mad? What can you
mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Merely this. It is very simple, after all. With
one hand I relieve the children’s suffering; with
the other I take dividends from the very mills
that make the children suffer. A long time ago
I wanted to ‘divvy up’ with Patty, and Bobby
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
and the rest. I have even thought lately that
I would still like to ‘divvy up’; and—well, you
can see the way I am ‘divvying up’ now with
my people down there at the mills!” And her
voice rang with self-scorn.
</p>
<p>
The man frowned. He, too, got to his feet
and walked nervously up and down the room.
When he came back the girl had sat down again.
Her elbows were on the table, and her linked
fingers were shielding her eyes. Involuntarily
the man reached his hand toward the bowed
head. But he drew it back before it had touched
a thread of the bronze-gold hair.
</p>
<p>
“I do see, Margaret,” he began gently, “and
you are right. It is at the mills themselves that
the first start must be made—the first beginning
of the ‘divvying up.’ Perhaps, if there were
some one to show us”—he paused, then went
on unsteadily: “I suppose it’s useless to say
again what I said that day months ago: that if
you stayed here, and showed him—the man who
loves you—the better way——”
</p>
<p>
Margaret started. She gave a nervous little
laugh and picked up a bit of paper from the
floor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
</p>
<p>
“Of course it is useless,” she retorted in what
she hoped was a merry voice. “And he doesn’t
even love me now, besides.”
</p>
<p>
“He doesn’t love you!” Frank Spencer’s eyes
and voice were amazed.
</p>
<p>
“Of course not! He never did, for that matter.
’Twas only the fancy of a moment. Why,
Frank, Ned never cared for me—that way!”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Ned!</em>” The tone and the one word were
enough. For one moment Margaret gazed into
the man’s face with startled eyes; then she turned
and covered her own telltale face with her hands—and
because it was a telltale face, Spencer took
a long stride toward her.
</p>
<p>
“Margaret! And did you think it was Ned I
was pleading for, when all the while it was I who
was hungering for you with a love that sent me
across the seas to rid myself of it? Did you,
Margaret?”
</p>
<p>
There was no answer.
</p>
<p>
“Margaret, look at me—let me see your eyes!”
There was a note of triumphant joy in his voice
now.
</p>
<p>
Still no answer.
</p>
<p>
“Margaret, it did not go—that love. It stayed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
with me day after day, and month after month,
and it only grew stronger and deeper until there
was nothing left me in all this world but you—just
you. And now—Margaret, my Margaret,” he said
softly and very tenderly. “You <em>are</em> my Margaret!”
And his arms closed about her.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>CHAPTER XLI</h2>
<p>
In spite of protests and pleadings Margaret
spent the winter abroad.
</p>
<p>
“As if I’d stay here and flaunt my happiness
in poor Bobby’s face!” she said indignantly
to her lover. Neither would she consent to a
formal engagement. Even Mrs. Merideth and
Ned were not to know.
</p>
<p>
“It is to be just as it was before,” she had
declared decidedly, “only—well, you may write
to me,” she had conceded. “I refuse to stay
here and—and be just happy—<em>yet</em>! I’ve been
unkind and thoughtless, and have brought sorrow
to my dear good friend. I’m going away. I
deserve it—and Bobby deserves it, too!” And in
spite of Frank Spencer’s efforts to make her see
matters in a different light, she still adhered to her
purpose.
</p>
<p>
All through the long winter Frank contented
himself with writing voluminous letters, and telling
her of the plans he was making to “divvy up”
at the mills, as he always called it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
</p>
<p>
“I shall make mistakes, of course, dear,” he
wrote. “It is a big problem—altogether more so
than perhaps you realize. Of course the mills
must still be a business—not a philanthropy;
otherwise we should defeat our own ends. But I
shall have your clear head and warm heart to aid
me, and little by little we shall win success.
</p>
<p>
“Already I have introduced two or three small
changes to prepare the way for the larger ones
later on. Even Ned is getting interested, and
seems to approve of my work, somewhat to my
surprise, I will own. I’m thinking, however, that
I’m not the only one in the house, sweetheart, to
whom you and your unselfishness have shown the
‘better way.’”
</p>
<p>
Month by month the winter passed, and
spring came, bringing Mrs. Merideth, but no
Margaret.
</p>
<p>
“She has stopped to visit friends in New York,”
explained Mrs. Merideth, in reply to her brother’s
anxious questions. “She may go on west with
them. She said she would write you.”
</p>
<p>
Margaret did “go on west,” and it was while she
was still in the west that she received a letter from
Patty, a portion of which ran thus:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mebbe youd like to know about Bobby
McGinnis. Bobby is goin to get married. She
seemed to comfort him lots after you went. Shes
that pretty and sympathizing in her ways you
know. I think he was kind of surprised hisself,
but the first thing he knew he was in love with
her. I think he felt kind of bad at first on account
of you. But I told him that was all nonsense, and
that I knew youd want him to do it. I think his
feelins for you was more worship than love, anyhow.
He didn’t never seem happy even when he
was engaged to you. But hes happy now, and
Arabella thinks hes jest perfect. Oh, I told you
twas Arabella didn’t I? Well, tis. And say its her
thats been learnin me to spell. Ain’t it jest
grand?”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Not very many days later Frank Spencer at
Hilcrest received a small card on which had been
written:
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Patty Durgin announces the engagement
of her sister, Arabella Murphy, to Mr. Robert
McGinnis.”
</p>
<p>
Beneath, in very fine letters was: “I’m coming
home the eighteenth. Please tell Della;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>
and—you may tell her anything else that you like.
<span class='sc'>Margaret</span>.”
</p>
<p>
For a moment the man stared at the card with
puzzled eyes; then he suddenly understood.
</p>
<p>
“Della,” he cried joyously, a minute later,
“Della, she’s coming the eighteenth!”
</p>
<p>
“Who’s coming the eighteenth?”
</p>
<p>
Frank hesitated. A light that was half serious,
half whimsical, and wholly tender, came into
his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“My wife,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Your <em>wife</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you know her as Margaret Kendall,”
retorted Frank with an airiness that was intended
to hide the shake in his voice. “But she will be
my wife before she leaves here again.”
</p>
<p>
“Frank!” cried Mrs. Merideth, joyfully, “you
don’t mean——” But Frank was gone. Over
his shoulder, however, he had tossed a smile and
a reassuring nod.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Merideth sank back with a sigh of content.
</p>
<p>
“It’s exactly what I always hoped would happen,”
she said.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
